But 82
it 67

that 11
he 962
may 49
fall 29
in 2719
love 29
with 34
one 19
of 109
them 9
and 51
you 29
must 28
visit 14
him 9
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
comes 4
I 4330
see 70
no 896
occasion 7
for 484
that 11
You 29
and 51
the 193
may 49
go 500
or 333
you 29
may 49
send 10
them 9
by 57
will 39
be 1201
still 13
better 7
for 484
as 509
you 29
are 12
as 509
handsome 6
as 509
any 17
of 109
them 9
Mr 5
may 49
like 22
you 29
the 193
best 37
of 109
the 193
party 3
My 90
dear 15
you 29
flatter 10
me 1041
I 4330
have 11
had 11
my 90
share 22
of 109
but 82
I 4330
do 814
not 85
pretend 7
to 805
be 1201
anything 3
now 10
When 6
a 6799
woman 21
has 41
five 5
grown 4
up 194
she 199
to 805
give 15
over 596
of 109
her 181
own 9
In 2719
a 6799
woman 21
has 41
not 85
often 4
to 805
think 8
of 109
But 82
my 90
dear 15
you 29
must 28
go 500
and 51
see 70
Mr 5
when 6
he 962
comes 4
into 26
the 193
It 67
is 124
more 11
than 22
I 4330
engage 6
for 484
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
But 82
consider 13
your 4
think 8
what 14
an 970
establishment 3
it 67
would 5
be 1201
for 484
one 19
of 109
them 9
Sir 22
William 3
and 51
Lady 18
are 12
to 805
go 500
on 86
that 11
account 14
for 484
in 2719
general 22
you 29
know 12
they 5
visit 14
no 896
you 29
must 28
go 500
for 484
it 67
will 39
be 1201
for 484
us 70
to 805
visit 14
him 9
if 8
you 29
do 814
not 85
You 29
are 12
over 596
scrupulous 4
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
Mr 5
will 39
be 1201
glad 30
to 805
see 70
you 29
and 51
I 4330
will 39
send 10
a 6799
few 6
lines 4
by 57
you 29
to 805
assure 6
him 9
of 109
my 90
consent 5
to 805
his 43
he 962
of 109
the 193
though 12
I 4330
must 28
throw 14
in 2719
a 6799
good 28
word 26
for 484
my 90
little 6
I 4330
desire 6
you 29
will 39
do 814
no 896
thing 15
is 124
not 85
a 6799
bit 48
better 7
than 22
the 193
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
is 124
not 85
half 23
so 797
handsome 6
as 509
Jane 8
nor 102
half 23
so 797
good 28
as 509
Lydia 4
But 82
you 29
are 12
her 181
the 193
preference 3
They 5
have 11
none 32
of 109
them 9
to 805
recommend 8
them 9
he 962
they 5
are 12
all 162
and 51
like 22
other 5
but 82
has 41
something 3
more 11
of 109
than 22
her 181
Mr 5
how 27
can 287
you 29
abuse 7
your 4
own 9
in 2719
a 6799
way 27
You 29
take 18
delight 8
in 2719
me 1041
You 29
have 11
no 896
compassion 4
for 484
my 90
poor 11
You 29
mistake 5
me 1041
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
high 54
respect 18
for 484
your 4
They 5
are 12
my 90
old 21
friends 4
I 4330
have 11
you 29
mention 5
them 9
with 34
consideration 3
these 4
last 7
at 272
least 3
Ah 17
you 29
do 814
not 85
know 12
what 14
I 4330
suffer 11
But 82
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
get 13
over 596
it 67
and 51
live 43
to 805
see 70
young 9
men 140
of 109
four 26
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
come 36
into 26
the 193
It 67
will 39
be 1201
no 896
use 18
to 805
us 70
if 8

come 36
since 7
you 29
will 39
not 85
visit 14
them 9
Depend 17

my 90
dear 15
that 11
when 6
there 21
are 12
I 4330
will 39
visit 14
them 9
all 162
Mr 5
was 93
so 797
odd 17
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
quick 25
reserve 7
and 51
caprice 3
that 11
the 193
experience 4
of 109
three 12
and 51
had 11
to 805
make 17
his 43
wife 6
understand 8
his 43
character 16
Her 181
mind 25
was 93
less 19
difficult 5
to 805
develop 12
She 199
was 93
a 6799
woman 21
of 109
mean 36
understanding 4
little 6
information 3
and 51
uncertain 5
temper 22
When 6
she 199
was 93
she 199
nervous 4
The 193
business 13
of 109
her 181
life 44
was 93
to 805
get 13
her 181
married 3
solace 4
was 93
and 51
news 71
Chapter 3
Mr 5
was 93
the 193
of 109
who 79
on 86
Mr 5
He 962
had 11
intended 3
to 805
visit 14
him 9
though 12
to 805
the 193
last 7
his 43
wife 6
that 11
he 962
should 7
not 85
go 500
and 51
till 14
the 193
evening 3
after 48
the 193
visit 14
was 93
she 199
had 11
no 896
knowledge 4
of 109
it 67
It 67
was 93
then 5
in 2719
the 193
following 3
manner 8
his 43
second 16
daughter 4
in 2719
trimming 4
a 6799
hat 64
he 962
her 181
with 34
I 4330
hope 16
Mr 5
will 39
like 22
it 67
We 444
are 12
not 85
in 2719
a 6799
way 27
to 805
know 12
what 14
Mr 5
her 181
mother 21
since 7
we 444
are 12
not 85
to 805
visit 14
But 82
you 29
forget 8
mamma 9
Elizabeth 5
that 11
we 444
shall 12
meet 9
him 9
at 272
the 193
and 51
that 11
Long 49
to 805
introduce 3
him 9
I 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
Long 49
will 39
do 814
any 17
thing 15
She 199
has 41
two 14
of 109
her 181
own 9
She 199
is 124
a 6799
selfish 4
woman 21
and 51
I 4330
have 11
no 896
opinion 4
of 109
her 181
No 896
more 11
have 11
I 4330
Mr 5
and 51
I 4330
am 392
glad 30
to 805
find 10
that 11
you 29
do 814
not 85
depend 17
on 86
her 181
serving 3
you 29
not 85
to 805
make 17
any 17
reply 3
but 82
to 805
contain 16
scolding 3
one 19
of 109

keep 11
so 797
for 484
Have 11
a 6799

compassion 4
on 86
my 90
You 29

no 896
discretion 3
in 2719
her 181
her 181
father 12
she 199
times 10
them 9
ill 84
I 4330
do 814

for 484
my 90
own 9
amusement 3
When 6
is 124
your 4
ball 77
to 805
be 1201
To 805
morrow 3
fortnight 4
Aye 4
so 797
it 67
is 124
her 181
mother 21
and 51
Long 49
does 5
not 85
come 36
back 182
till 14
the 193
day 27
so 797
it 67
will 39
be 1201
for 484
her 181
to 805
introduce 3
him 9
for 484
she 199
will 39
not 85
know 12
him 9
Then 5
my 90
dear 15
you 29
may 49
have 11
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
your 4
friend 14
and 51
introduce 3
Mr 5
to 805
her 181
Mr 5
when 6
I 4330
am 392
not 85
with 34
him 9
how 27
can 287
you 29
be 1201
so 797
I 4330
your 4
A 6799
acquaintance 5
is 124
little 6
One 19
know 12
what 14
a 6799
man 342
is 124
by 57
the 193
end 92
of 109
a 6799
fortnight 4
But 82
if 8
we 444
do 814
not 85
venture 8
will 39
and 51
after 48
all 162
Long 49
and 51
her 181
must 28
stand 42
chance 20
and 51
as 509
she 199
will 39
think 8
it 67
an 970
act 69
of 109
kindness 3
if 8
you 29
decline 7
the 193
office 11
I 4330
will 39
take 18
it 67
on 86
The 193
at 272
father 12
What 14
can 287
be 1201
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
that 11
exclamation 3
he 962
Do 814
you 29
consider 13
the 193
of 109
introduction 3
and 51
the 193
stress 6
that 11
is 124
on 86
them 9
as 509
I 4330
agree 11
with 34
you 29
there 21
What 14
say 7
you 29
Mary 13
For 484
you 29
are 12
a 6799
young 9
lady 18
of 109
deep 12
reflection 3
I 4330
know 12
and 51
read 49
great 12
books 15
and 51
make 17
Mary 13
to 805
say 7
something 3
sensible 3
but 82
not 85
how 27
While 4
Mary 13
is 124
her 181
he 962
let 50
us 70
return 14
to 805
Mr 5
I 4330
am 392
sick 38
of 109
Mr 5
his 43
wife 6
I 4330
am 392
to 805
hear 76
that 11
but 82
why 4
did 23
not 85
you 29
tell 16
me 1041
that 11
If 8
I 4330
had 11
as 509
this 6
morning 3
I 4330
would 5
not 85
have 11
on 86
him 9
It 67
is 124
but 82
as 509
I 4330
have 11
the 193
visit 14
we 444
escape 10
the 193
acquaintance 5
now 10
The 193
of 109
the 193
was 93
just 24
what 14
he 962
that 11
of 109
the 193
rest 110
though 12
when 6
the 193
first 8
tumult 5
of 109
joy 36
was 93
over 596
she 199
to 805
declare 6
that 11
it 67
was 93
what 14
she 199
had 11
all 162
the 193
while 4
How 27
good 28
it 67
was 93
in 2719
you 29
my 90
dear 15

would 5
be 1204
a 6800
misfortune 3
to 805
be 1204
by 57
him 9
Long 50
me 1042
last 7
night 61
that 11
he 963
sat 92
close 22
to 805
her 182
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
opening 3
his 43
lips 8
Are 12
you 29
sure 11
is 124
not 85
there 21
a 6800
little 6
mistake 5
Jane 9
I 4330
saw 24
Mr 5
to 805
her 182
Aye 4
she 199
him 9
at 272
last 7
how 27
he 963
and 51
he 963
not 85
help 23
her 182
but 82
she 199
he 963
at 272
being 3
spoke 14
to 805
Miss 71
me 1042
Jane 9
that 11
he 963
never 3
his 43
intimate 5
acquaintances 3
With 34
them 9
he 963
is 124
agreeable 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
a 6800
word 26
of 109
it 67
my 90
dear 15
If 8
he 963
had 11
so 797
agreeable 3
he 963
would 5
have 11
to 805
Long 50
But 82
I 4330
can 288
guess 16
how 27
it 67
was 93
that 11
he 963
is 124
eat 15
up 194
with 34
pride 6
and 51
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
he 963
had 11
that 11
Long 50
does 5
not 85
keep 11
a 6800
carriage 5
and 51
had 11
come 36
to 805
the 193
ball 77
in 2719
a 6800
hack 28
chaise 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
mind 25
his 43
not 85
to 805
Long 50
Miss 71
but 82
I 4330
wish 13
he 963
had 11
with 34
Eliza 7
time 45
her 182
mother 21
I 4330
would 5
not 85
dance 7
with 34
him 9
if 8
I 4330
were 5
you 29
I 4330
believe 6
I 4330
may 49
promise 4
you 29
never 3
to 805
dance 7
with 34
him 9
His 43
pride 6
Miss 71
does 5
not 85
offend 7
me 1042
so 797
as 509
pride 6
often 4
does 5
there 21
is 124
an 970
excuse 4
for 484
it 67
One 19
wonder 17
that 11
so 797
fine 17
a 6800
young 9
man 342
with 34
fortune 8
in 2719
his 43
should 7
think 8
of 109
If 8
I 4330
may 49
so 797
express 25
it 67
he 963
has 41
a 6800
right 31
to 805
be 1204
proud 5
That 11
is 124
true 9
Elizabeth 5
and 51
I 4330
forgive 8
his 43
pride 6
if 8
he 963
had 11
not 85
mine 26
Pride 6
Mary 13
who 79
the 193
of 109
her 182
is 124
a 6800
common 23
failing 3
I 4330
believe 6
By 57
all 162
that 11
I 4330
have 11
ever 33
read 49
I 4330
am 393
that 11
it 67
is 124
common 23
that 11
human 41
nature 3
is 124
prone 3
to 805
it 67
and 51
that 11
there 21
are 12
few 6
of 109
us 70
who 79
do 814
not 85
cherish 4
a 6800
feeling 4
of 109
self 11
on 86
the 193
score 19
of 109
some 30
or 333
other 5
real 47
or 333
and 51
pride 6
are 12
different 11
though 12
the 193
words 5
are 12
often 4
A 6800
person 33
may 49
be 1204
proud 5
being 3
vain 8
Pride 6
more 11
to 805
our 3
opinion 4
of 109
to 805
what 14
we 444
would 5
have 11
think 8
of 109
us 70
If 8
I 4330
were 5
as 509
rich 19
as 509
Mr 5
a 6800
young 9
who 79
came 36
with 34
his 43
I 4330
should 7
not 85
care 47
how 27
proud 5
I 4330
was 93
I 4330
would 5
keep 11
a 6800
pack 29
of 109
and 51
drink 9
a 6800
bottle 10
of 109
wine 18
a 6800
day 27
Then 5
you 29
would 5
drink 9
a 6800
great 12
deal 13
more 11
than 22
you 29
Bennet 4
and 51
if 8
I 4330
were 5
to 805
see 70
you 29
at 272
it 67
I 4330
should 7
take 18
your 4
bottle 10
The 193
boy 25
that 11
she 199
should 7
not 85
she 199
to 805
declare 6
that 11
she 199
would 5
and 51

argument 9
with 34
the 193
visit 14
Chapter 3
The 193
of 109
soon 3
on 86
of 109
The 193
visit 14
was 93
soon 3
in 2719
due 21
form 68
Miss 71
pleasing 3
on 86
the 193
of 109
and 51
Miss 71
and 51
though 12
the 193
mother 21
was 93
found 18
to 805
be 1204
and 51
the 193
not 85
worth 15
to 805
a 6800
wish 13
of 109
being 3
better 7
with 34
them 9
was 93
the 193
two 14
By 57
Jane 9
this 6
attention 3
was 93
with 34
the 193
pleasure 5
but 82
Elizabeth 5
still 13
saw 24
in 2719
treatment 3
of 109
even 36
her 182
sister 9
and 51
not 85
like 22
them 9
though 12
kindness 3
to 805
Jane 9
as 509
it 67
was 93
had 11
a 6800
value 8
as 509
in 2719
all 162
the 193
influence 4
of 109
It 67
was 93
they 5
met 180
that 11
he 963
did 23
admire 6
her 182
and 51
to 805
her 182
it 67
was 93
that 11
Jane 9
was 93
to 805
the 193
preference 3
she 199
had 11
to 805
entertain 12
for 484
him 9
the 193
first 8
and 51
was 93
in 2719
a 6800
way 27
to 805
be 1204
in 2719
love 29
but 82
she 199
with 34
pleasure 5
that 11
it 67
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1204
by 57
the 193
world 12
in 2719
general 22
since 7
Jane 9
with 34
great 12
strength 10
of 109
feeling 4
a 6800
of 109
temper 22
and 51
a 6800
uniform 8
of 109
manner 8
would 5
guard 26
her 182
the 193
of 109
the 193
She 199
this 6
to 805
her 182
friend 14
Miss 71
It 67
may 49
be 1204
pleasant 9
Charlotte 4
to 805
be 1204
able 3
to 805
impose 6
on 86
the 193
public 18
in 2719
a 6800
case 25
but 82
it 67
is 124
a 6800
disadvantage 6
to 805
be 1204
so 797
If 8
a 6800
woman 21
her 182
affection 5
with 34
the 193
same 5
skill 11
the 193
object 26
of 109
it 67
she 199
may 49
lose 5
the 193
of 109
fixing 3
him 9
and 51
it 67
will 39
then 5
be 1204
but 82
poor 11
consolation 3
to 805
believe 6
the 193
world 12
in 2719
the 193
dark 19
There 21
is 124
so 797
of 109
or 333
in 2719
every 10
attachment 3
that 11
it 67
is 124
not 85
safe 20
to 805
leave 14
any 17
to 805
We 444
can 288
all 162
begin 8
a 6800
slight 10
preference 3
is 124
natural 18
but 82
there 21
are 12
few 6
of 109
us 70
who 79
have 11
heart 57
to 805
be 1204
in 2719
love 29
encouragement 3
In 2719
nine 21
out 365
of 109
ten 151
a 6800
woman 21
had 11
better 7
show 64
more 11
affection 5
than 22
she 199
your 4
sister 9
but 82
he 963
may 49
never 3
do 814
more 11
than 22
like 22
her 182
if 8
she 199
does 5
not 85
help 23
him 9
on 86
But 82
she 199
does 5
help 23
him 9
on 86
as 509
as 509
her 182
nature 3
will 39
allow 9
If 8
I 4330
can 288
perceive 3
her 182
regard 7
for 484
him 9
he 963
must 28
be 1204
a 6800
simpleton 3
not 85
to 805
discover 10
it 67
too 50
Remember 4
Eliza 7
that 11
he 963
does 5
not 85
know 12
disposition 3
as 509
you 29
do 814
But 82
if 8
a 6800
woman 21
is 124
partial 6
to 805
a 6800
man 342
and 51
does 5
not 85
to 805
conceal 10
it 67
he 963
must 28
find 10
it 67
out 365
he 963
must 28
if 8
he 963
sees 6
of 109
her 182
But 82
though 12
and 51
Jane 9
meet 9
often 4
it 67
is 124
never 3
for 484
together 3
and 51
as 509
they 5
see 70
other 5
in 2719
large 11
it 67
is 124
that 11
every 10
moment 14
should 7
be 1204
in 2719
together 3
Jane 9
should 7
make 17
the 193
most 3
of 109
every 10
half 23
hour 10
in 2719
she 199
can 288
command 21
his 43
attention 3
When 6
she 199
is 124
secure 6
of 109
him 9
there 21
will 39
be 1204
more 11
leisure 8
for 484
in 2719
love 29
as 509
as 509
she 199
Your 4
plan 61
is 124
a 6800
good 28
one 19
Elizabeth 5
where 21
nothing 5
is 124
in 2719
question 16
but 82
the 193
desire 6
of 109
being 3
well 24
married 3
and 51
if 8
I 4330
were 5
to 805
get 13
a 6800
rich 19
husband 10
or 333
any 17
husband 10
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
I 4330
should 7
adopt 12
it 67
But 82
these 4
are 12
not 85
she 199
is 124
not 85
by 57
design 16
As 509
yet 4
she 199
even 36
be 1204
certain 5
of 109
the 193
degree 3
of 109
her 182
own 9
regard 7
nor 102
of 109
She 199
has 41
him 9
a 6800
fortnight 4
She 199
four 26
with 34
him 9
at 272
she 199
saw 24
him 9
one 19
morning 3
at 272
his 43
own 9
house 87
and 51
has 41
since 7
with 34
him 9
in 2719
four 26
times 10
This 6
is 124
not 85
to 805
make 17
her 182
understand 8
his 43
character 16
Not 85
as 509
you 29
represent 11
it 67
Had 11
she 199
with 34
him 9
she 199
might 9
have 11
he 963
had 11
a 6800
good 28
appetite 3
but 82
you 29
must 28
remember 4
that 11
four 26
have 11
also 3
together 3
and 51
four 26
may 49
do 814
a 6800
great 12
deal 13
Yes 16
these 4
four 26
have 11
them 9
to 805
ascertain 7
that 11
they 5
both 8
like 22
un 1982
better 7
than 22
but 82
with 34
respect 18
to 805
any 17
other 5
characteristic 4
I 4330
do 814
not 85
imagine 3
that 11
has 41
Well 24
Charlotte 4
I 4330
wish 13
Jane 9
success 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
and 51
if 8
she 199
were 5
married 3
to 805
him 9
to 805
morrow 3
I 4330
should 7
think 8
she 199
had 11
as 509
good 28
a 6800
chance 20
of 109
as 509
if 8
she 199
were 5
to 805
be 1204
his 43
character 16
for 484
a 6800
twelvemonth 3
in 2719
marriage 6
is 124
a 6800
matter 7
of 109
chance 20
If 8
the 193
of 109
the 193
are 12
ever 33
so 797
well 24
to 805
other 5
or 333
ever 33
so 797
similar 5
it 67
does 5
not 85
advance 7
in 2719
the 193
least 3
They 5
continue 3
to 805
grow 21
unlike 10
to 805
have 11
share 22
of 109
vexation 3
and 51
it 67
is 124
better 7
to 805
know 12
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
of 109
the 193
of 109
the 193
person 33
with 34
whom 3
you 29
are 12
to 805
pass 66
your 4
life 44
You 29
make 17
me 1042
laugh 14
Charlotte 4
but 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
sound 29
You 29
know 12
it 67
is 124
not 85
sound 29
and 51
that 11
you 29
would 5
never 3
act 69
in 2719
this 6
way 27
in 2719
Mr 5
to 805
her 182
sister 9
Elizabeth 5
was 93
far 91
that 11
she 199
was 93
an 970
object 26
of 109
some 30
interest 6
in 2719
the 193
eyes 8
of 109
his 43
friend 14
Mr 5
had 11
at 272
first 8
her 182
to 805
be 1204
pretty 3
he 963
had 11
at 272
her 182
at 272
the 193
ball 77
and 51
when 6
they 5
met 180
he 963
at 272
her 182
to 805
But 82
no 896
had 11
he 963
made 13
it 67
clear 23
to 805
and 51
his 43
friends 4
that 11
she 199
had 11
a 6800
good 28
feature 5
in 2719
her 182
face 19
than 22
he 963
to 805
find 10
it 67
was 93
intelligent 4
by 57
the 193
expression 11
of 109
her 182
dark 19
eyes 8
To 805
this 6
some 30
Though 12
he 963
had 11
with 34
a 6800
eye 57
more 11
than 22
one 19
failure 3
of 109
perfect 24
in 2719
her 182
form 68
he 963
was 93
to 805
acknowledge 3
her 182
figure 7
to 805
be 1204
light 42
and 51
pleasing 3
and 51
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
his 43
that 11
her 182
were 5
not 85
of 109
the 193
world 12
he 963
was 93
by 57
Of 109
this 6
she 199
was 93
unaware 4
to 805
her 182
he 963
was 93
the 193
man 342
who 79
made 13
agreeable 3
and 51
who 79
had 11
not 85
thought 11
her 182
handsome 6
to 805
dance 7
with 34
He 963
to 805
wish 13
to 805
know 12
more 11
of 109
her 182
and 51
as 509
a 6800
step 48
with 34
her 182
to 805
her 182
conversation 8
with 34
His 43
doing 3
so 797
her 182
notice 8
It 67
was 93
at 272
Sir 22
William 3
where 21
a 6800
large 11
party 3
were 5
What 14
does 5
Mr 5
mean 36
she 199
to 805
Charlotte 4
by 57
to 805
my 90
conversation 8
with 34
Colonel 5
That 11
is 124
a 6800
question 16
Mr 5
can 288
answer 8
But 82
if 8
he 963
does 5
it 67
any 17
more 11
I 4330
shall 12
let 50
him 9
know 12
that 11
I 4330
see 70
what 14
he 963

it 67
had 11
given 3
her 182
a 6800

conceited 4
manner 8
would 5
have 11
a 6800
degree 3

more 11
pleasure 5
though 12
not 85
half 23

in 2719
silent 6
at 272
a 6800

passing 3
the 193

the 193
exclusion 4
of 109
all 162

was 93
too 50
by 57
his 43
to 805
perceive 3
that 11
Sir 22
William 3
Lucas 3
was 93
his 43

Sir 22
William 3
What 14
a 6800

young 9
people 4
this 6
is 124
Mr 5
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
like 22
after 48
all 162
I 4330
consider 13
it 67
as 509
one 19
of 109
the 193
first 8
of 109
sir 22
and 51
it 67
has 41
the 193
advantage 6
also 3
of 109
being 3
in 2719
vogue 3
the 193
less 19
of 109
the 193
world 12
Every 10
savage 12
can 288
dance 7
Sir 22
William 3
Your 4
friend 14

after 48
a 6800
pause 4
on 86
join 16
the 193
group 15
and 51
I 4330
doubt 15
not 85
that 11
you 29
are 12
an 970
adept 6
in 2719
the 193
science 3
Mr 5
You 29
saw 24
me 1042
dance 7
at 272
I 4330
believe 6
sir 22
Yes 16
and 51
no 896
pleasure 5
the 193
sight 17
Do 814
you 29
often 4
dance 7
at 272
St 1910
Never 3
sir 22
Do 814
you 29
not 85
think 8
it 67
would 5
be 1204
a 6800
proper 9
compliment 6
to 805
the 193
place 29
It 67
is 124
a 6800
compliment 6
I 4330
never 3
pay 52
to 805
any 17
place 29
if 8
I 4330
can 288
avoid 8
it 67
You 29
have 11
a 6800
house 87
in 2719
town 27
I 4330
conclude 3
Mr 5
I 4330
had 11
had 11
some 30
thought 11
of 109
fixing 3
in 2719
town 27
for 484
I 4330
am 393
fond 17
of 109
superior 5
but 82
I 4330
did 23
not 85
feel 11
certain 5
that 11
the 193
air 129
of 109
London 5
would 5
agree 11
with 34
Lady 18
Lucas 3
He 963
in 2719
of 109
an 970
answer 8
but 82
his 43

and 51
Elizabeth 5
at 272

instant 11

he 963

the 193
action 4
of 109

a 6800
gallant 6

and 51
out 365
to 805
her 182
My 90
dear 15
Miss 71
Eliza 7
why 4
are 12
you 29

allow 9
me 1042

I 4330
am 393
sure 11
when 6
so 797
is 124
you 29
And 51
taking 4
her 182
hand 137
he 963
would 5
have 11
given 3
it 67
to 805
Mr 5

though 12

not 85
unwilling 4
to 805

with 34
some 30
to 805
Sir 22
William 3

not 85
the 193

intention 5
of 109

not 85

suppose 4
that 11

grave 28
to 805
be 1204
the 193
of 109
her 182
hand 137
but 82
in 2719

Elizabeth 5
was 93
nor 102
did 23
Sir 22
William 3
at 272

are 12
all 162
of 110
them 9
clever 6
This 6
is 124
the 193
point 22
I 4330
flatter 10
on 86

do 814
not 85
agree 11
I 4330
had 11
that 11
our 3

every 10
particular 13
but 82
I 4330
must 28
so 797
far 91
differ 18
you 29
as 509

think 8
our 3
two 14
foolish 4
My 90

When 6
they 5

to 805
our 3
age 24
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
they 5
will 39
not 85
think 8
any 17
more 11
than 22
we 444
do 814
I 4330
remember 4
the 193
time 45
when 6
I 4330

red 211
coat 12
well 24
and 51
so 797
I 4330
do 814
still 13
at 272
my 90
heart 57
and 51
if 8
a 6800
smart 20
young 9
colonel 5
with 34
five 5
or 333
six 24
thousand 7
a 6800
year 19
should 7
want 13
one 19

conceited 4

It 67
shows 5
an 970

pleasing 3
I 4330
am 393
Mr 5
Miss 71
in 2719
a 6800
half 23
whisper 8
that 11

Not 85

A 6800
short 62
pause 4
this 6
speech 13
and 51
Hurst 3
I 4330
have 11
an 970
regard 7
for 484
Miss 71

I 4330
am 393
there 21

no 896
chance 20
of 110

That 11
is 124
capital 17
her 182

and 51
they 5
both 8
If 8
they 5
had 11
to 805
fill 25
all 162
it 67
would 5
not 85
make 17
them 9
one 19
jot 10
less 19
agreeable 3
But 82
it 67
must 28
lessen 4

consideration 3
in 2719
the 193

To 805

late 23
in 2719
the 193

then 5
you 29

so 797
to 805
it 67

Neglect 9
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
you 29

nothing 5
that 11

But 82
I 4330

take 18

think 8
it 67
more 11
possible 3
to 805
get 13
by 57
purchase 7
than 22
by 57
imitation 3
Elizabeth 5

with 34
what 14
as 509
to 805
leave 14
her 182

attention 3
for 484
her 182

Miss 71
Elizabeth 5

How 27

so 797
a 6800
countenance 4
And 51
so 797
for 484
her 182
age 24
Her 182
performance 3
on 86
the 193
pianoforte 3
is 124
exquisite 4
It 67
is 124
to 805
me 1042
how 27
young 9
can 288
have 11
to 805
be 1204
so 797
as 509
they 5
all 162
are 12
All 162
young 9
My 90
dear 15
Charles 5
what 14
do 814
you 29
mean 36
Yes 16
all 162
of 110
them 9
I 4330
think 8
They 5
all 162
paint 19
tables 7
cover 21
and 51
net 40
I 4330
know 12
who 79
do 814
all 162
this 6
and 51
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
I 4330
never 3
a 6800
young 9
lady 18
of 110
for 484
the 193
first 8
time 45
being 3
that 11
she 199
was 93
Your 4
list 27
of 110
the 193
common 23
extent 3
of 110
has 41
too 50
truth 7
The 193
word 26
is 124
to 805
a 6800
woman 21
who 79
it 67
no 896
than 22
by 57
a 6800
purse 7
or 333
covering 3
a 6800
screen 15
But 82
I 4330
am 393
far 91
with 34
you 29
in 2719
your 4
estimation 3
of 110
in 2719
general 22
I 4330
boast 12
of 110
knowing 3
more 11
than 22
half 23
a 6800
dozen 4
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
range 9
of 110
my 90
acquaintance 5
that 11
are 12
Nor 102
I 4330
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
Miss 71
Then 5
Elizabeth 5
you 29
must 28
comprehend 4
a 6800
great 12
deal 13
in 2719
your 4
idea 21
of 110
an 970
woman 21
Yes 16
I 4330
do 814
comprehend 4
a 6800
great 12
deal 13
in 2719
it 67
Oh 17
his 43
faithful 6
assistant 3
no 896
one 19
can 288
be 1204
who 79
does 5
not 85
surpass 4
what 14
is 124
met 180
with 34
A 6800
woman 21
must 28
have 11
a 6800
thorough 13
knowledge 4
of 110
music 24
drawing 3
and 51
the 193
modern 23
to 805
deserve 4
the 193
word 26
and 51
all 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
possess 16
a 6800
certain 5
something 3
in 2719
her 182
air 129
and 51
manner 8
of 110
the 193
tone 12
of 110
her 182
voice 8
her 182
address 9
and 51
or 333
the 193
word 26
will 40
be 1204
but 82
half 23
All 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
possess 16
and 51
to 805
all 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
yet 4
add 54
something 3
more 11
in 2719
the 193
improvement 3
of 110
her 182
mind 25
by 57
extensive 4
reading 3
I 4330
am 393
no 896
at 272
your 4
knowing 3
six 24
women 5
I 4330
wonder 17
now 10
at 272
your 4
knowing 3
any 17
Are 12
you 29
so 797
severe 7
your 4
own 9
sex 45
as 509
to 805
doubt 15
the 193
of 110
all 162
this 6
I 4330
never 3
saw 24
a 6800
woman 21
I 4330
never 3
saw 24
and 51
taste 15
and 51
application 3
and 51
as 509
you 29
describe 6
Hurst 3
and 51
Miss 71
both 8
out 365
the 193
injustice 3
of 110
her 182
doubt 15
and 51
were 5
both 8
that 11
they 5
women 5
who 79
this 6

Mr 5
Hurst 3

with 34
bitter 15
of 110

what 14
was 93
going 3
forward 12
As 509
all 162

was 93
at 272
an 970

Elizabeth 5
soon 3
left 19

Elizabeth 5
Bennet 4
Miss 71
when 6

recommend 8
to 805
the 193
other 5
sex 45
by 57
own 9
and 51
with 34
men 140
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
it 67
But 82
in 2719
my 90
opinion 4
it 67
is 124
a 6800
device 3
a 6800
mean 36
art 104
to 805
whom 3
this 6
remark 9
was 93
there 21
is 124
a 6800

to 805

for 484
bears 4
to 805
cunning 7
is 124
Miss 71
was 93
not 85
so 797
with 34
this 6
reply 3
as 509
to 805
continue 3
the 193
subject 11
Elizabeth 5

to 805
say 7
that 11
her 182
sister 10
was 93
worse 6
and 51
that 11
she 199
not 85
leave 14
her 182
Mr 5
being 3
sent 35
for 484
while 4
his 43

for 484
one 19
of 110
the 193
most 3
This 6
she 199
would 5
not 85
hear 76
of 110
but 82
she 199
was 93
not 85
so 797
unwilling 4
to 805
with 34
proposal 3
and 51
it 67
was 93
that 11
Mr 5
should 7

ill 84
and 51
a 6800
vast 8
deal 13
though 12
with 34
the 193
in 2719
the 193
world 12
is 124
the 193
way 27
with 34
her 182
for 484
she 199
has 41
exception 6
the 193
temper 22
I 4330
have 11
ever 33

tell 16
my 90
other 5
they 5

nothing 5
to 805
her 182
You 29

a 6800
sweet 33
room 22
here 31
Mr 5
and 51
a 6800
prospect 13
over 597
the 193
gravel 7
walk 25
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
a 6800
place 29
in 2719
the 193
country 12
that 11
is 124
equal 17
to 805
You 29
will 40
not 85
think 8
of 110
it 67
in 2719
a 6800
hurry 3
I 4330
hope 16
though 12
you 29
have 11
but 82
a 6800
short 62
lease 16
I 4330
do 814
is 124
done 3
in 2719
a 6800
hurry 3
he 963
and 51
if 8
I 4330
should 7
resolve 5
to 805
quit 14
I 4330
should 7
be 1204
off 101
in 2719
five 5
At 272
present 20
I 4330
consider 13
as 509
here 31
That 11
is 124
what 14
I 4330
should 7
have 11
of 110
you 29
Elizabeth 5
You 29
begin 8
to 805
comprehend 4
me 1042
do 814
you 29
he 963
turning 3
her 182
Oh 17
yes 16
I 4330
understand 8
you 29
I 4330
wish 13
I 4330
might 9
take 18
this 6
for 484
a 6800
compliment 6
but 82
to 805
be 1204
so 797
through 4
I 4330
am 393
is 124
That 11
is 124
as 509
it 67
happens 4
It 67
does 5
not 85
follow 11
that 11
a 6800
deep 12
character 16
is 124
more 11
or 333
less 19
than 22
a 6800
one 19
as 509
yours 3
her 182
mother 21
remember 4
where 21
you 29
are 12
and 51
do 814
not 85
run 50
on 86
in 2719
the 193
wild 36
manner 8
that 11
you 29
are 12
to 805
do 814
at 272
home 90
I 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
were 5
a 6800
of 110
character 16
It 67
must 28
be 1204
an 970
study 3
Yes 16
but 82
are 12
the 193
most 3
They 5
have 11
at 272
least 3
that 11
advantage 6
The 193
country 12
can 288
in 2719
general 22
supply 3
but 82
a 6800
few 6
for 484
a 6800
study 3
In 2719
a 6800
country 12
you 29
move 10
in 2719
a 6800
and 51
But 82
people 4
alter 27
so 797
that 11
there 21
is 124
something 3
new 115
to 805
be 1204
in 2719
them 9
for 484
ever 33
Yes 16
Bennet 4
by 57
his 43
manner 8
of 110
a 6800
country 12
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
there 21
is 124
as 509
of 110
that 11
going 3
on 86
in 2719
the 193
country 12
as 509
in 2719
town 27
was 93
and 51
after 48
at 272
her 182
for 484
a 6800
moment 14
Bennet 4
who 79
she 199
had 11
a 6800
complete 8
over 597
him 9
her 182
triumph 10
I 4330
see 70
that 11
London 5
has 41
any 17
great 12
advantage 6
over 597
the 193
country 12
for 484
my 90
part 102
except 10
the 193
and 51
public 18
The 193
country 12
is 124
a 6800
vast 8
deal 13
is 124
it 67
not 85
Mr 5
When 6
I 4330
am 393
in 2719
the 193
country 12
he 963
I 4330
never 3
wish 13
to 805
leave 14
it 67
and 51
when 6
I 4330
am 393
in 2719
town 27
it 67
is 124
pretty 3
the 193
same 5
They 5
have 11
and 51
I 4330
can 288
be 1204
in 2719
Aye 4
that 11
is 124
you 29
have 11
the 193
right 31
disposition 3
But 82
that 11
gentleman 4
at 272
to 805
think 8
the 193
country 12
was 93
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
Mamma 9
you 29
are 12
Elizabeth 5
for 484
her 182
mother 21
You 29
Mr 5
He 963
meant 3
that 11
there 21
was 93
not 85
a 6800
of 110
people 4
to 805
be 1204
met 180
with 34
in 2719
the 193
country 12
as 509
in 2719
the 193
town 27
you 29
must 28
acknowledge 3
to 805
be 1204
true 9
my 90
dear 15
there 21
were 5
but 82
as 509
to 805
not 85
meeting 6
with 34
people 4
in 2719
this 6
I 4330
believe 6
there 21
are 12
few 6
I 4330
know 12
we 444
dine 9
with 34
four 26
and 51
Nothing 5
but 82
concern 6
for 484
Elizabeth 5
enable 6
to 805
keep 11
his 43
countenance 4
His 43
sister 10
was 93
less 19
delicate 7
and 51
her 182
eyes 8
Mr 5
with 34
a 6800
expressive 4
smile 7
Elizabeth 5
for 484
the 193
sake 3
of 110
saying 3
something 3
that 11
might 9
turn 46
her 182
now 10
her 182
if 8
Charlotte 4
Lucas 3
had 11
at 272
since 7
her 182
coming 3
Yes 16
she 199
yesterday 3
with 34
her 182
father 12
What 14
an 970
agreeable 3
man 342
Sir 22
William 4
is 124
Mr 5
is 124
not 85
he 963
So 797
the 193
man 342
of 110
fashion 10
So 797
genteel 4
and 51
He 963
has 41
something 3
to 805
say 7
to 805
That 11
is 124
my 90
idea 21
of 110
good 28
and 51
who 79
fancy 5
and 51
never 3
open 21
mistake 5
the 193
matter 7
Did 23
Charlotte 4
dine 9
with 34
you 29
No 896
she 199
would 5
go 500
home 90
I 4330
fancy 5
she 199
was 93
the 193
mince 9
For 484
my 90
part 102
Mr 5
I 4330
keep 11
that 11
can 288
do 814
own 9
work 87
my 90
are 12
up 194
But 82
is 124
to 805
judge 7
for 484
and 51
the 193
are 12
a 6800
good 28
sort 14
of 110
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
It 67
is 124
a 6800
pity 4
they 5
are 12
not 85
handsome 6
Not 85
that 11
I 4330
think 8
Charlotte 4
so 797
plain 27
but 82
then 5
she 199
is 124
our 3
particular 13
friend 14
She 199
a 6800
pleasant 9
young 9
woman 21
Oh 17
dear 15
yes 16
but 82
you 29
must 28
own 9
she 199
is 124
plain 27
Lady 18
Lucas 3
has 41
often 4
so 797
and 51
me 1042
I 4330
do 814
not 85
like 22
to 805
boast 12
of 110
my 90
own 9
child 28
but 82
to 805
be 1204
sure 11
Jane 9
one 19
does 5
not 85
often 4
see 70
better 7
It 67
is 124
what 14
I 4330
do 814
not 85
trust 26
my 90
own 9
When 6
she 199
was 93
fifteen 6
there 21
was 93
a 6800
man 342
at 272
my 90
brother 9
in 2719
town 27
so 797
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 182
that 11
my 90
sister 10
in 2719
law 45
was 93
sure 11
he 963
would 5
make 17
her 182
an 970
offer 10
we 444
came 36
But 82
he 963
did 23
not 85
he 963
thought 11
her 182
too 50
young 9
he 963
some 30
on 86
her 182
and 51
pretty 3
they 5
were 5
And 51
so 797
his 43
affection 5
Elizabeth 5
There 21
has 41
a 6800
one 19
I 4330
fancy 5
in 2719
the 193
same 5
way 27
I 4330
wonder 17
who 79
first 8
the 193
of 110
in 2719
love 29
I 4330
have 11
to 805
consider 13
as 509
the 193
food 9
of 110
love 29
Of 110
a 6800
fine 17
stout 9
love 29
it 67
may 49
what 14
is 124
strong 16
But 82
if 8
it 67
be 1204
a 6800
slight 11
thin 35
sort 14
of 110
inclination 3
I 4330
am 393
that 11
one 19
good 28
sonnet 3
will 40
starve 6
it 67
and 51
the 193
general 22
pause 4
made 13
Elizabeth 5
tremble 4
lest 5
her 182
mother 21
should 7
be 1204
She 199
to 805
speak 12
but 82
think 8
of 110
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
and 51
after 48
a 6800
short 62
silence 7
Bennet 4
her 182
thanks 4
to 805
Mr 5
for 484
his 43
kindness 3
to 805
Jane 9
with 34
an 970
for 484
him 9
also 3
with 34
Mr 5
was 93
civil 15
in 2719
his 43
answer 8
and 51
his 43
sister 10
to 805
be 1204
civil 15
also 3
and 51
say 7
what 14
the 193
occasion 7
She 199
her 182
part 102
but 82
Bennet 4
was 93
and 51
soon 3
her 182
carriage 5
this 6
signal 18
the 193
of 110
her 182
put 47
forward 12
The 193
two 14
had 11
to 805
other 5
the 193
whole 26
visit 14
and 51
the 193
result 8
of 110
it 67
was 93
that 11
the 193
should 7
tax 42
Mr 5
with 34
on 86
his 43
first 8
coming 3
into 26
the 193
country 12
to 805
give 15
a 6800
ball 77
at 272
Lydia 4
was 93
a 6800
stout 9
well 24
grown 4
girl 14
of 110
fifteen 6
with 34
a 6800
fine 17
complexion 5
and 51
good 28
countenance 4
a 6800
with 34
her 182
mother 21
affection 5
had 11
her 182
into 26
public 18
at 272
an 970
age 24
She 199
had 11
high 54
animal 6
and 51
a 6800
sort 14
of 110
natural 18
self 11
consequence 3
the 193
attention 3
of 110
the 193
to 805
whom 3
her 182
good 28
and 51
her 182
own 9
her 182
had 11
into 26
assurance 3
She 199
was 93
equal 17
to 805
address 9
Mr 5
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 110
the 193
ball 77
and 51
him 9
of 110
his 43
promise 4
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1204
the 193
most 3
shameful 4
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
if 8
he 963
did 23
not 85
keep 11
it 67
His 43
answer 8
to 805
this 6
sudden 4
attack 8
was 93
to 805
ear 114
I 4330
am 393
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
to 805
keep 11
my 90
engagement 3
and 51
when 6
your 4
sister 10
is 124
you 29
shall 12
if 8
you 29
please 3
name 17
the 193
day 27
of 110
the 193
ball 77
But 82
you 29
would 5
not 85
wish 13
to 805
be 1204
when 6
she 199
is 124
ill 84
Lydia 4
Oh 17
yes 16
it 67
would 5
be 1204
better 7
to 805
wait 19
till 14
Jane 9

the 193
course 10
of 110
a 6800
year 19
of 110
business 13
too 50
How 27
odious 4
I 4330
should 7

It 67

then 5
that 11
they 5
fall 29

little 6
design 16
for 484
a 6800
table 27

it 67
superior 5

me 1042
leave 14
to 805
defer 14
your 4

At 272

Oh 17
it 67

of 110
no 896
consequence 3
I 4330
shall 12
see 70
her 182

But 82
do 814
you 29
write 5
long 50
to 805
her 182
Mr 5
They 5
are 12
long 50
but 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
for 484
me 1042
to 805
determine 7
It 67
is 124
a 6800
rule 7
with 34
me 1042
that 11
a 6800
person 33
who 79
can 288
write 5
a 6800
long 50
letter 20
with 34
ease 10
write 5
ill 84
That 11
will 40
not 85
do 814
for 484
a 6800
compliment 6
to 805
her 182
brother 9
he 963
does 5
not 85
write 5
with 34
ease 10
He 963
too 50
for 484
words 5
of 110
four 26
Do 814
not 85
you 29
My 90
style 4
of 110
writing 3
is 124
different 11
yours 3
Oh 17
Miss 71
Charles 5
in 2719
the 193
most 3
careless 4
way 27
He 963
out 365
half 23
his 43
words 5
and 51
the 193
rest 110
My 90
flow 27
so 797
that 11
I 4330
have 11
not 85
time 45
to 805
express 25
them 9
by 57
my 90
convey 12
no 896
at 272
all 162
to 805
my 90
Your 4
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5
must 28
disarm 7
reproof 5
Nothing 5
is 124
more 11
deceitful 4
than 22
the 193
appearance 3
of 110
It 67
is 124
often 4
of 110
opinion 4
and 51
an 970
indirect 6
boast 12
And 51
of 110
the 193
two 14
do 814
you 29
call 57
my 90
little 6
recent 6
piece 10
of 110
The 193
indirect 6
boast 12
for 484
you 29
are 12
proud 5
of 110
your 4
in 2719
writing 3
you 29
consider 13
them 9
as 509
proceeding 3
a 6800
of 110
thought 11
and 51
of 110
execution 6
if 8
not 85
you 29
think 8
at 272
least 3
The 193
power 19
of 110
doing 3
anything 3
with 34
is 124
by 57
the 193
possessor 3
and 51
often 4
any 17
attention 3
to 805
the 193
imperfection 3
of 110
the 193
performance 3
When 6
you 29
Bennet 4
this 6
morning 3
that 11
if 8
you 29
ever 33
you 29
should 7
be 1204
gone 4
in 2719
five 5
you 29
meant 3
it 67
to 805
be 1204
a 6800
sort 14
of 110
panegyric 3
of 110
compliment 6
to 805
and 51
yet 4
what 14
is 124
there 21
so 797
in 2719
a 6800
must 28
leave 14
business 13
and 51
can 288
be 1204
of 110
no 896
real 47
advantage 6
to 805
or 333
Nay 6
this 6
is 124
too 50
to 805
remember 4
at 272
night 61
all 162
the 193
foolish 4
that 11
were 5
in 2719
the 193
morning 3
And 51
yet 4
my 90
I 4330
believe 6
what 14
I 4330
of 110
to 805
be 1204
true 9
and 51
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
at 272
this 6
moment 14
At 272
least 3
I 4330
did 23
not 85
assume 3
the 193
character 16
of 110
needless 4
to 805
show 64
off 101
the 193
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
you 29
it 67
but 82
I 4330
am 393
by 57
no 896
that 11
you 29
would 5
be 1204
gone 4
with 34
Your 4
conduct 21
would 5
be 1204
as 509
dependent 4
on 86
chance 20
as 509
that 11
of 110
any 17
man 342
I 4330
know 12
and 51
if 8
as 509
you 29
were 5
mounting 3
your 4
horse 52
a 6800
friend 14
were 5
to 805
say 7
you 29
had 11
better 7
stay 7
till 14
week 20
' 4
you 29
would 5
do 814
it 67
you 29
would 5
not 85
go 500
and 51
at 272
word 26
might 9
stay 7
a 6800
month 6
You 29
have 11
by 57
this 6
Elizabeth 5
that 11
Mr 5
did 23
not 85
do 814
justice 3
to 805
his 43
own 9
disposition 3
You 29
have 11
him 9
off 101
now 10
more 11
than 22
he 963
did 23
I 4330
am 393
by 57
your 4
what 14
my 90
friend 14
into 26
a 6800
compliment 6
on 86
the 193
of 110
my 90
temper 22
But 82
I 4330
am 393
you 29
are 12
it 67
a 6800
turn 46
that 11
gentleman 4
did 23
by 57
no 896
intend 6
for 484
he 963
would 5
think 8
better 7
of 110
me 1042
if 8
under 288
a 6800
circumstance 4
I 4330
were 5
to 805
give 15
a 6800
flat 66
denial 3
and 51
ride 9
off 101
as 509
fast 29
as 509
I 4330
Would 5
Mr 5
then 5
consider 13
the 193
of 110
your 4
original 6
as 509
for 484
by 57
your 4
in 2719
to 805
it 67
my 90
word 26
I 4330
explain 5
the 193
matter 7
must 28
speak 12
for 484
You 29
expect 20
me 1042
to 805
account 14
for 484
you 29
choose 5
to 805
call 57
mine 26
but 82
I 4330
have 11
never 3
the 193
case 25
to 805
stand 42
to 805
your 4
representation 4
you 29
must 28
remember 4
Miss 71
Bennet 4
that 11
the 193
friend 14
who 79
is 124
to 805
desire 6
his 43
return 14
to 805
the 193
house 87
and 51
the 193
delay 8
of 110
his 43
plan 61
has 41
it 67

offering 3
one 19
argument 9
in 2719
favour 4
of 110
To 805

to 805
the 193
persuasion 3
of 110
a 6800

no 896
merit 13
with 34
you 29
To 805

the 193
understanding 4
of 110
You 29

me 1042
Mr 5
to 805
allow 9
nothing 5
for 484
the 193
influence 4
of 110
friendship 3
and 51
affection 5
A 6800
regard 7
for 484
the 193

often 4
make 17
one 19
yield 6
to 805
a 6800
request 6
for 484

reason 13
one 19
into 26

Mr 5
We 444
may 49
as 509
well 24
wait 19
till 14
the 193

the 193
discretion 3

where 21
one 19
of 110
them 9
is 124
by 57
the 193
other 5
to 805
change 21
a 6800
resolution 3
of 110
no 896
great 12
moment 14
should 7
you 29
think 8
ill 84
of 110
that 11

for 484
with 34
the 193
desire 6

Will 40
it 67
not 85

we 444
proceed 7
on 86
this 6

to 805
arrange 9
with 34

the 193
degree 3
of 110
is 124
to 805
appertain 4
to 805
this 6
request 6
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
degree 3
of 110
the 193
By 57
all 162
let 50
us 70
hear 76
all 162
the 193
not 85
comparative 4
height 7
and 51
size 5
for 484
that 11
will 40
have 11
more 11
weight 21
in 2719
the 193
argument 9
Miss 71
Bennet 4
than 22
you 29
may 49
be 1204
aware 3
of 110
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
that 11
if 8
were 5
not 85
a 6800
great 12
tall 35
fellow 9
in 2719
comparison 3
with 34
I 4330
should 7
not 85
pay 52
him 9
half 23
so 797
I 4330
declare 6
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
a 6800
more 11
awful 6
object 26
than 22
on 86
particular 13
and 51
in 2719
particular 13
at 272
his 43
own 9
house 87
and 51
of 110
a 6800
Sunday 3
evening 3
when 6
he 963
has 41
nothing 5
to 805
do 814
Mr 5
but 82
Elizabeth 5
thought 11
she 199
perceive 3
that 11
he 963
was 93
and 51
her 182
laugh 14
Miss 71
the 193
he 963
had 11
in 2719
an 970
expostulation 3
with 34
her 182
brother 9
for 484
I 4330
see 70
your 4
design 16
his 43
friend 14
You 29
dislike 4
an 970
argument 9
and 51
want 13
to 805
silence 7
this 6
I 4330
do 814
are 12
too 50
like 22
If 8
you 29
and 51
Miss 71
Bennet 4
will 40
defer 14
yours 3
till 14
I 4330
am 393
out 365
of 110
the 193
room 22
I 4330
shall 12
be 1204
thankful 4
and 51
then 5
you 29
may 49
say 7
you 29
like 22
of 110
me 1042
What 14
you 29
ask 6
Elizabeth 5
is 124
no 896
sacrifice 4
on 86
my 90
side 74
and 51
Mr 5
had 11
better 7
finish 8
his 43
letter 20
Mr 5
her 182
and 51
did 23
finish 8
his 43
letter 20
When 6
that 11
business 13
was 93
over 597
he 963
to 805
Miss 71
and 51

for 484
an 970
indulgence 3
of 110
some 30
music 24
Miss 71
with 34
some 30
to 805
the 193
pianoforte 3
and 51
after 48
a 6800
polite 8
request 6
that 11
Elizabeth 5
would 5
lead 15
the 193
way 27
the 193
other 5
as 509
and 51
more 11
she 199
Hurst 3
sang 11
with 34
her 182
sister 10
and 51
while 4
they 5
were 5
Elizabeth 5
not 85
help 23
as 509
she 199
over 597
some 30
music 24
books 15
that 11
lay 42
on 86
the 193
instrument 16
how 27
Mr 5
eyes 8
were 5
on 86
her 182
She 199
how 27
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
she 199
be 1204
an 970
object 26
of 110
to 805
so 797
great 12
a 6800
man 342
and 51
yet 4
that 11
he 963
should 7
look 14
at 272
her 182
he 963
her 182
was 93
still 13
more 11
strange 8
She 199
imagine 3
at 272
last 7
that 11
she 199
his 43
notice 8
there 21
was 93
something 3
more 11
wrong 24
and 51
to 805
his 43
of 110
right 31
than 22
in 2719
any 17
other 5
person 33
present 20
The 193
supposition 3

She 199

too 50

After 48

soon 3
Mr 5

Elizabeth 5
to 805
her 182
Do 814
not 85
you 29
feel 11
a 6800
great 12
inclination 3
Miss 71
Bennet 4
to 805
seize 3
an 970
of 110
a 6800
reel 12
She 199
but 82
made 13
no 896
answer 8
He 963
the 193
question 16
with 34
some 30
surprise 4
at 272
her 182
silence 7
Oh 17
she 199
I 4330
you 29
but 82
I 4330
not 85
determine 7
what 14
to 805

You 29
me 1042
I 4330
know 12
to 805
say 7
' 5
that 11
you 29
might 9
have 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 110
my 90
taste 15
but 82
I 4330
delight 8
in 2719
kind 31
of 110
and 51
a 6800
person 33
of 110
contempt 8
I 4330
have 11
made 13
up 194
my 90
mind 25
to 805
tell 16
you 29
that 11
I 4330
do 814
not 85
want 13
to 805
dance 7
a 6800

at 272
all 162
and 51
now 10
despise 3
me 1042
if 8
you 29
dare 15
I 4330
do 814
not 85
dare 15
Elizabeth 5
to 805
affront 5
him 9
was 93
at 272
his 43
but 82
there 21
was 93
a 6800
mixture 3
of 110
and 51
in 2719
her 182
manner 8
made 13
it 67
difficult 5
for 484
her 182
to 805
affront 5
and 51
had 11
never 3
so 797
by 57
any 17
woman 21
as 509
he 963
was 93
by 57
her 182
He 963
that 11
were 5
it 67
not 85
for 484
the 193
of 110
her 182
he 963
should 7
be 1204
in 2719
some 30
danger 7
Miss 71
saw 24
or 333
to 805
be 1204
jealous 5
and 51
her 182
great 12
for 484
the 193
of 110
her 182
dear 15
friend 14
Jane 9
some 30
her 182
desire 6
of 110
rid 42
of 110
Elizabeth 5
She 199
often 4
to 805
provoke 6
into 26
her 182
guest 9
by 57
of 110
marriage 6
and 51
his 43
in 2719
an 970
alliance 3
I 4330
hope 16
she 199
as 509
they 5
were 5
together 3
in 2719
the 193
the 193
day 27
you 29
will 40
give 15
your 4
mother 21
in 2719
law 45
a 6800
few 6
when 6
this 6
desirable 3
event 18
place 29
as 509
to 805
the 193
advantage 6
of 110
holding 3
her 182
tongue 5
and 51
if 8
you 29
can 288
compass 9
it 67
do 814
cure 9
the 193
of 110
after 48
And 51
if 8
I 4330
may 49
mention 5
so 797
delicate 7
a 6800
subject 11
to 805
check 40
that 11
little 6
something 3
on 86
conceit 7
and 51
impertinence 3
your 4
lady 18
Have 11
you 29
anything 3
to 805
propose 6
for 484
my 90
domestic 12
Oh 17
yes 16
Do 814
let 50
the 193
of 110
your 4
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
be 1204
in 2719
the 193
at 272
Put 47
them 9
to 805
your 4
great 12
uncle 18
the 193
judge 7
They 5
are 12
in 2719
the 193
same 5
profession 14
you 29
know 12
in 2719
different 11
lines 4
As 509
for 484
your 4
picture 8
you 29
must 28
not 85
have 11
it 67
for 484
what 14
painter 4
do 814
justice 3
to 805
eyes 8
It 67
would 5
not 85
be 1204
to 805
catch 24
expression 11
but 82
and 51
shape 13
and 51
the 193
so 797
fine 17
might 9
be 1204
At 272
that 11
moment 14
they 5
were 5
met 180
walk 25
by 57
Hurst 3
and 51
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
intended 3
to 805
walk 25
Miss 71
in 2719
some 30
confusion 3
lest 5
they 5
had 11
You 29
us 70
ill 84
Hurst 3
us 70
that 11
you 29
were 5
coming 3
out 365
Then 5
taking 4
the 193
arm 82
of 110
Mr 5
she 199
left 19
Elizabeth 5
to 805
walk 25
by 57
The 193
path 25
just 24
three 12
Mr 5
felt 5
and 51
This 6
walk 25
is 124
not 85
wide 15
for 484
our 3
party 3
We 444
had 11
better 7
go 500
into 26
the 193
avenue 3
But 82
Elizabeth 5
who 79
had 11
not 85
the 193
least 3
inclination 3
to 805
remain 9
with 34
them 9
No 896
no 896
stay 7
where 21
you 29
are 12
You 29
are 12
and 51
appear 7
to 805
uncommon 6
advantage 6
The 193
picturesque 4
would 5
be 1204
by 57
a 6800
fourth 4
Good 28
bye 5
She 199
then 5
ran 110
off 101
rejoicing 3
as 509
she 199
in 2719
the 193
hope 16
of 110
being 3
at 272
home 90
in 2719
a 6800
day 27
or 333
two 14
Jane 9
was 93
so 797
as 509
to 805
intend 6
leaving 3
her 182
room 22
for 484
a 6800
couple 7
of 110
that 11
evening 3
Chapter 3
When 6
the 193
after 48
dinner 9
Elizabeth 5
ran 110
up 194
to 805
her 182
sister 10
and 51
her 182
well 24
cold 9
her 182
into 26
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
where 21
she 199
was 93
by 57
her 182
two 14
friends 4
with 34
of 110
pleasure 5
and 51
Elizabeth 5
had 11
never 3
them 9
so 797
agreeable 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
the 193
hour 10
the 193
of 110
conversation 8
were 5
They 5
describe 6
an 970
entertainment 3
with 34
relate 8
an 970
anecdote 3
with 34
and 51
laugh 14
at 272
acquaintance 5
with 34
spirit 20
But 82
when 6
the 193
Jane 9
was 93
no 896
the 193
first 8
object 26
Miss 71
eyes 8
were 5
and 51
she 199
had 11
something 3
to 805
say 7
to 805
him 9
he 963
had 11
steps 7
He 963
to 805
Miss 71
Bennet 4
with 34
a 6800
polite 8
congratulation 3
Mr 5
Hurst 3
also 3
made 13
her 182
a 6800
slight 11
bow 58
and 51
he 963
was 93
glad 30
but 82
and 51
for 484
salutation 3
He 963
was 93
full 16
of 110
joy 36
and 51
attention 3
The 193
first 8
half 23
hour 10
was 93
in 2719
piling 3
up 194
the 193
fire 103
lest 5
she 199
should 7
suffer 11
the 193
change 21
of 110
room 22
and 51
she 199
at 272
his 43
desire 6
to 805
the 193
other 5
side 74
of 110
the 193
fireplace 3
that 11
she 199
might 9
be 1204
further 8
the 193
door 41
He 963
then 5
sat 92
down 90
by 57
her 182
and 51
to 805
Elizabeth 5
at 272
work 87
in 2719
the 193
opposite 4
corner 8
saw 24
it 67
all 162
with 34
great 12
delight 8
When 6
tea 99
was 93
over 597
Mr 5
Hurst 3
his 43
sister 10
in 2719
law 45
of 110
the 193
card 54
table 27
but 82
in 2719
vain 8
She 199
had 11
private 9
that 11
Mr 5
did 23
not 85
wish 13
for 484
cards 7
and 51
Mr 5
Hurst 3
soon 3
found 18
even 36
his 43
open 21
petition 8
She 199
assured 4
him 9
that 11
no 896
one 19
intended 3
to 805
play 73
and 51
the 193
silence 7
of 110
the 193
whole 26
party 3
on 86
the 193
subject 11
to 805
her 182
Mr 5
Hurst 3
had 11
nothing 5
to 805
do 814
but 82
to 805
stretch 15
on 86
one 19
of 110
the 193
and 51
go 500
to 805
sleep 33
up 194
a 6800
book 69
Miss 71
did 23
the 193
same 5
and 51
Hurst 3
in 2719
with 34
her 182
and 51
rings 3
now 10
and 51
then 5
in 2719
her 182
conversation 8
with 34
Miss 71
Bennet 4
Miss 71
attention 3
was 93
as 509
in 2719
Mr 5
progress 14
through 4
his 43
book 69
as 509
in 2719
reading 3
her 182
own 9
and 51
she 199
was 93
making 4
some 30
or 333
at 272
his 43
page 15
She 199
not 85
win 229
him 9
to 805
any 17
conversation 8
he 963
her 182
question 16
and 51
read 49
on 86
At 272
length 14
by 57
the 193
attempt 5
to 805
be 1204
with 34
her 182
own 9
book 69
she 199
had 11
it 67
was 93
the 193
second 16
volume 3
of 110
his 43
she 199
gave 4
a 6800
great 12
yawn 8
and 51
How 27
pleasant 9
it 67
is 124
to 805
spend 11
an 970
evening 3
in 2719
this 6
way 27
I 4330
declare 6
after 48
all 162
there 21
is 124
no 896
enjoyment 3
like 22
reading 3
How 27
one 19
tires 7
of 110
anything 3
than 22
of 110
a 6800
book 69
When 6
I 4330
have 11
a 6800
house 87
of 110
my 90
own 9
I 4330
shall 12
be 1204
miserable 3
if 8
I 4330
have 11
not 85
an 970
No 896
one 19
made 13
any 17
reply 3
She 199
then 5
aside 3
her 182
book 69
and 51
cast 54
her 182
eyes 8
round 29
the 193
room 22
in 2719
quest 21
for 484
some 30
amusement 3
when 6
hearing 3
her 182
brother 9
a 6800
ball 77
to 805
Miss 71
Bennet 4
she 199
him 9
and 51
By 57
the 193
bye 5
Charles 5
are 12
you 29
serious 4
in 2719
a 6800
dance 7
at 272
I 4330
would 5
advise 9
you 29
you 29
determine 7
on 86
it 67
to 805
consult 14
the 193
of 110
the 193
present 20
party 3
I 4330
am 393
if 8
there 21
are 12
not 85
some 30
us 70
to 805
whom 3
a 6800
ball 77
would 5
be 1204
a 6800
punishment 3
than 22
a 6800
pleasure 5
If 8
you 29
mean 36
her 182
brother 9
he 963
may 49
go 500
to 805
bed 93
if 8
he 963
it 67
but 82
as 509
for 484
the 193
ball 77
it 67
is 124
a 6800
thing 15
and 51
as 509
soon 3
as 509
has 41
made 13
white 55
soup 13
I 4330
shall 12
send 10
round 29
my 90
cards 7
I 4330
should 7
like 22
balls 7
better 7
she 199
if 8
they 5
were 5
on 86
in 2719
a 6800
different 11
manner 8
but 82
there 21
is 124
something 3
tedious 4
in 2719
the 193
usual 3
process 16
of 110
a 6800
meeting 6
It 67
would 5
be 1204
more 11
rational 22
if 8
conversation 8
of 110
were 5
made 13
the 193
order 11
of 110
the 193
day 27
more 11
rational 22
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
but 82
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1204
near 15
so 797
like 22
a 6800
ball 77
Miss 71
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
soon 3
she 199
got 14
up 194
and 51
the 193
room 22
Her 182
figure 7
was 93
and 51
she 199
well 24
but 82
at 272
whom 3
it 67
was 93
all 162
was 93
still 13
studious 4
In 2719
the 193
of 110
her 182
she 199
on 86
one 19
effort 7
more 11
and 51
turning 3
to 805
Elizabeth 5
Miss 71
Eliza 7
Bennet 4
let 50
me 1042
persuade 6
you 29
to 805
follow 11
my 90
example 4
and 51
take 18
a 6800
turn 46
the 193
room 22
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
it 67
is 124
after 48
sitting 3
so 797
long 50
in 2719
one 19
attitude 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
but 82
to 805
it 67
Miss 71
no 896
less 19
in 2719
the 193
real 47
object 26
of 110
her 182
Mr 5
up 194
He 963
was 93
as 509
awake 8
to 805
the 193
of 110
attention 3
in 2719
that 11
quarter 25
as 509
Elizabeth 5
be 1204
and 51
his 43
book 69
He 963
was 93
to 805
join 16
party 3
but 82
he 963
it 67
that 11
he 963
imagine 3
but 82
two 14
for 484
to 805
walk 25
up 194
and 51
down 90
the 193
room 22
together 3
with 34
of 110
his 43
them 9
would 5
interfere 5
What 14
he 963
mean 36
She 199
was 93
to 805
know 12
what 14
be 1204
his 43
meaning 11
and 51
Elizabeth 5
she 199
at 272
all 162
understand 8
him 9
Not 85
at 272
all 162
was 93
her 182
answer 8
but 82
depend 17
it 67
he 963
to 805
be 1204
severe 7
on 86
us 70
and 51
our 3
way 27
of 110
him 9
will 40
be 1204
to 805
ask 6
nothing 5
it 67
Miss 71
was 93
of 110
Mr 5
in 2719
anything 3
and 51
in 2719
an 970
explanation 3
of 110
his 43
two 14
I 4330
have 11
not 85
the 193
objection 5
to 805
them 9
he 963
as 509
soon 3
as 509
she 199
him 9
to 805
speak 12
You 29
choose 5
this 6
method 18
of 110
passing 3
the 193
evening 3
you 29
are 12
in 2719
confidence 3
and 51
have 11
secret 25
to 805
discuss 10
or 333
you 29
are 12
conscious 5
that 11
your 4
appear 7
to 805
the 193
advantage 6
in 2719
if 8
the 193
first 8
I 4330
would 5
be 1204
in 2719
your 4
way 27
and 51
if 8
the 193
second 16
I 4330
can 288
admire 6
you 29
better 7
as 509
I 4330
sit 29
by 57
the 193
fire 103
Oh 17
Miss 71
I 4330
never 3
anything 3
so 797
How 27
shall 12
we 444
punish 9
him 9
for 484
a 6800
speech 13
Nothing 5
so 797
if 8
you 29

him 9
Intimate 5

how 27
it 67

But 82
my 90
I 4330

I 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29

And 51
as 509

Elizabeth 5
That 11
is 124
an 970
uncommon 6
advantage 6
and 51
uncommon 6
I 4330
hope 16
it 67
will 40
continue 3
for 484
it 67
would 5
be 1204
a 6800
great 12
loss 3
to 805
me 1042
to 805

I 4330

Miss 71

more 11

be 1204
The 193

the 193
best 37
of 110
men 140
nay 6
the 193
and 51
best 37
of 110
may 49
be 1204
ridiculous 4
by 57
a 6800
person 33
first 8
object 26
in 2719
life 44
is 124
a 6800
joke 8
Elizabeth 5
there 21
are 12
people 4
but 82
I 4330
hope 16
I 4330
am 393
not 85
one 19
of 110
them 9
I 4330
hope 16
I 4330
never 3
ridicule 4
what 14
is 124
wise 17
and 51
good 28
and 51
whims 8
and 51
do 814
divert 6
me 1042
I 4330
own 9
and 51
I 4330
laugh 14
at 272
them 9
I 4330
can 288
But 82
these 4
I 4330
suppose 4
are 12
what 14
you 29
are 12
that 11
is 124
not 85
possible 3
for 484
But 82
it 67
has 41
the 193
study 3
of 110
my 90
life 44
to 805
avoid 8
often 4
expose 4
a 6800
strong 16
understanding 4
to 805
ridicule 4
as 509
and 51
pride 6
Yes 16
is 124
a 6800
weakness 3
But 82
pride 6
where 21
there 21
is 124
a 6800
real 47
of 110
mind 25
pride 6
will 40
be 1204
under 288
good 28
regulation 3
Elizabeth 5
to 805
hide 18
a 6800
smile 7
Your 4
examination 3
of 110
Mr 5
is 124
over 597
I 4330
presume 3
Miss 71
and 51
pray 9
what 14
is 124
the 193
result 8
I 4330
am 393
by 57
it 67
that 11
Mr 5
has 41
no 896
defect 17
He 963
it 67
disguise 4
No 896
I 4330
have 11
made 13
no 896
pretension 3
I 4330
have 11
but 82
they 5
are 12
not 85
I 4330
hope 16
of 110
understanding 4
My 90
temper 22
I 4330
dare 15
not 85
vouch 11
for 484
It 67
is 124
I 4330
believe 6
too 50
little 6
too 50
little 6
for 484
the 193
convenience 3
of 110
the 193
world 12
I 4330
forget 8
the 193
and 51
of 110
so 797
soon 3
as 509
I 4330
nor 102
My 90
are 12
not 85
with 34
every 10
attempt 5
to 805
move 10
them 9
My 90
temper 22
would 5
be 1204
resentful 4
My 90
good 28
opinion 4
is 124
forever 3
That 11
is 124
a 6800
failing 3
Elizabeth 5
resentment 3
is 124
a 6800
shade 4
in 2719
a 6800
character 16
But 82
you 29
have 11
your 4
fault 20
well 24
I 4330
laugh 14
at 272
it 67
You 29
are 12
safe 20
me 1042
There 21
is 124

believe 6
in 2719
every 10
disposition 3
a 6800

yours 3

this 6
moment 15
It 67
is 124
not 85
Mr 5
her 182
husband 10
it 67
is 124
a 6800
person 33
whom 3
I 4330
never 3
saw 24
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
course 10
of 110
my 90
life 44
This 6
a 6800
general 22
and 51
he 963
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 110
being 3
by 57
his 43
wife 6
and 51
his 43
five 5
at 272
After 48
some 30
time 45
with 34

a 6800
month 6
ago 15
I 4330
this 6
letter 20
and 51
a 6800
fortnight 4
ago 15
I 4330
it 67
for 484
I 4330
thought 11
it 67
a 6800
case 25
of 110
some 30
and 51
attention 3
It 67
is 124
my 90
cousin 3
Mr 5
who 79
when 6
I 4330
am 393
dead 39
may 49
turn 46

Oh 17
my 90
dear 15
his 43
wife 6
I 4330
bear 30
to 805
hear 76
that 11
Pray 9
do 814
not 85
talk 18
of 110
that 11
odious 4
man 342
I 4330
do 814
think 8
it 67
is 124
the 193
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
that 11
your 4
estate 3
should 7
be 1204
your 4
own 9
and 51
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
if 8
I 4330
had 11
you 29
I 4330
should 7
have 11
long 50
ago 15
to 805
do 814
something 3
or 333
other 6
it 67
Jane 9
and 51
Elizabeth 5
to 805
explain 5
to 805
her 182
the 193
nature 3
of 110
an 970
entail 6
They 5
had 11
often 4
to 805
do 814
it 67
but 82
it 67
was 93
a 6800
subject 11
on 86
Bennet 4
was 93
the 193
reach 6
of 110
reason 13
and 51
she 199
to 805
rail 26
the 193
of 110
an 970
estate 3
a 6800
of 110
five 5
in 2719
favour 4
of 110
a 6800
man 342
whom 3
anything 3
It 67
is 124
a 6800
most 3
affair 3
Mr 5
Bennet 4
and 51
nothing 5
can 288
clear 23
Mr 5
the 193
guilt 9
of 110
But 82
if 8
you 29
will 40
listen 9
to 805
his 43
letter 20
you 29
may 49
be 1204
a 6800
little 6
by 57
his 43

He 963

polite 8
young 9

as 509
to 805
let 50
him 9
come 36
to 805
us 70
There 21
is 124
some 30
sense 8
in 2719
what 14
he 963
the 193

if 8

Though 12
it 67
is 124
difficult 5
Jane 9
to 805
guess 16
in 2719
what 14
way 27
he 963
can 288
mean 36
to 805
make 17

the 193

Elizabeth 5
was 93
by 57
his 43

his 43
kind 31
intention 5
of 110
christening 3

were 5
He 963
must 28
be 1204

I 4330
think 8
she 199
I 4330
make 17
him 9
out 365
There 21
is 124
something 3
pompous 4
in 2719
his 43
style 4
And 51
what 14
can 288
he 963
mean 36
by 57
for 484
being 3
in 2719
the 193

We 445
suppose 4
he 963
would 5

be 1204
a 6802

well 24
I 4330
am 393

In 2719
point 22
of 110
composition 3
Mary 13
the 193

does 5
not 85
seem 10
defective 6
The 193
idea 21
of 110
the 193
olive 6
branch 6
is 124
not 85
new 115
yet 4
I 4330
think 8
it 67
is 124
well 24
To 805

Lydia 4
the 193
letter 20
nor 102
writer 3

It 67
was 93
to 805
that 11
cousin 3
should 7
come 36
in 2719
a 6802

and 51
it 67
was 93
now 10
some 30

the 193
of 110
a 6802

As 509

Mr 5

done 3
of 110

ill 84
will 40
and 51
she 199
was 93
to 805
see 70
him 9
with 34
a 6802
degree 3
of 110
her 182
husband 10
and 51
Mr 5

Mr 5
Bennet 4
little 6
but 82
the 193

to 805
talk 18
and 51
Mr 5
in 2719
need 29
of 110
encouragement 3
nor 102
to 805
be 1204
silent 6
He 963
was 93
a 6802
tall 35
heavy 7
young 9
man 342
of 110
five 5
and 51
His 43
air 129
was 93
grave 28

formal 21
He 963
had 11

fine 17
a 6802

but 82
that 11
in 2719
this 6
instance 4
fame 3
had 11
short 62
of 110
the 193
truth 7
and 51
that 11
he 963
did 23
not 85
doubt 15
her 182
them 9
all 162
in 2719
due 21
time 45
of 110

This 6
was 93
not 85

the 193
taste 15
of 110
some 30
of 110
his 43
but 82

Ah 17

It 67
is 124
a 6802
grievous 4
affair 3
to 805

Not 85

but 82
that 11
I 4330

But 82

assure 6
the 193

At 272

but 82
when 6
we 445

his 43
commendation 3
of 110

have 11
heart 57
but 82
for 484
the 193
supposition 3
of 110
his 43
viewing 3
it 67
all 162

every 10

the 193
agreeable 3
manner 8
in 2719
he 963
fell 22
into 26
conversation 8
though 12
it 67
was 93
on 86
being 3
a 6803
wet 19
night 61
made 13
her 182
feel 11
that 11
the 193
most 3
topic 7
might 9
be 1204
by 57
the 193
skill 11
of 110
the 193

With 34
for 485
the 193

in 2719
Phillips 3
and 51
was 93

When 6

he 963
but 82
I 4330
shall 12
be 1204
glad 30
to 805
improve 6
for 485
in 2719
my 90
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
Phillips 3
was 93
glad 30
for 485
his 43

not 85
wait 19
for 485
his 43
reason 13
Mr 5
did 23
not 85
play 73
at 272

and 51
with 34
delight 8
was 93
he 963
at 272
the 193

Elizabeth 5
and 51
Lydia 5
At 272
first 8
there 21
danger 7
of 110
him 9
for 485
she 199
was 93
a 6803
most 3
talker 3
but 82
being 3
fond 17
of 110
she 199
soon 3
too 50
in 2719
the 193
game 24
too 50
eager 6
in 2719
making 4
bets 3
and 51
after 48
to 805
have 11
attention 3
for 485
in 2719
particular 13
for 485
the 193
common 23
of 110
the 193

Mr 5
was 93
at 272
leisure 8
to 805
talk 18
to 805
Elizabeth 5
and 51
she 199
was 93
willing 4
to 805
hear 76
him 9
though 12
what 14
she 199
to 805
hear 76
she 199
not 85
hope 16
to 805
be 1204
the 193
of 110
his 43
acquaintance 5
with 34
Mr 5
She 199
dared 6
not 85
even 36
mention 5
that 11
gentleman 4
Her 182
was 93
Mr 5
the 193
subject 11
He 963
how 27
far 91
was 93
and 51
after 48
her 182
answer 8
in 2719
a 6803
manner 8
how 27
long 50
Mr 5
had 11
there 21
a 6803
month 6
Elizabeth 5
and 51
then 5
unwilling 4
to 805
let 50
the 193
subject 11
drop 22
He 963
is 124
a 6803
man 342
of 110
large 11
in 2719
I 4330
understand 8
Yes 16
Mr 5
his 43
estate 3
there 21
is 124
a 6803
noble 13
one 19
A 6803
clear 23
ten 151
thousand 7
per 551
You 29
not 85
have 11
met 180
with 34
a 6804
person 33
more 11
of 110
you 29
certain 5
information 3
on 86
that 11
head 140
than 22
for 485
I 4330
have 11
with 34
his 43
in 2719
a 6804
particular 13
manner 8
my 90
Elizabeth 5
not 85
but 82
look 14
You 29
may 49
well 24
be 1204
Miss 71
Bennet 4
at 272
an 971
assertion 3
after 48
as 509
you 29
might 9
the 193
cold 9
manner 8
of 110
our 3
meeting 6
yesterday 3
Are 12
you 29
with 34
Mr 5
As 509
as 509
I 4330
ever 33
wish 13
to 805
be 1204
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
have 11
four 26
in 2719
the 193
same 5
house 87
with 34
him 9
and 51
I 4330
think 8
him 9
disagreeable 3
I 4330
have 11
no 896
right 31
to 805
give 15
my 90
opinion 4
as 509
to 805
his 43
being 3
agreeable 3
or 333
I 4330
am 393
not 85
to 805
form 68
one 19
I 4330
have 11
him 9
too 50
long 50
and 51
too 50
well 24
to 805
be 1204
a 6804
fair 25
judge 7
It 67
is 124
for 485
me 1042
to 805
be 1204
impartial 4
But 82
I 4330
believe 6
your 4
opinion 4
of 110
him 9
would 5
in 2719
general 22
astonish 7
and 51
you 29
would 5
not 85
express 25
it 67
so 797
Here 31
you 29
are 12
in 2719
your 4
own 9
my 90
word 26
I 4330
say 7
no 896
more 11
here 31
than 22
I 4330
might 9
say 7
in 2719
any 17
house 87
in 2719
the 193
except 10
He 963
is 124
not 85
at 272
all 162
in 2719
is 124
with 34
his 43
pride 6
You 29
will 40
not 85
find 10
him 9
more 11
of 110
by 57
I 4330
pretend 7
to 805
be 1204
after 48
a 6804
short 62
interruption 3
that 11
he 963
or 333
that 11
any 17
man 342
should 7
not 85
be 1204
but 82
with 34
him 9
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
does 5
not 85
often 4
happen 9
The 193
world 12
is 124
by 57
his 43
fortune 8
and 51
consequence 3
or 333
by 57
his 43
high 54
and 51
and 51
sees 6
him 9
as 509
he 963
to 805
be 1204
I 4330
should 7
take 18
him 9
even 36
on 86
my 90
slight 11
acquaintance 5
to 805
be 1204
an 971
ill 84
man 342
his 43
head 140
I 4330
wonder 17
he 963
at 272
the 193
of 110
he 963
is 124
to 805
be 1204
in 2719
this 6
country 12
I 4330
do 814
not 85
at 272
all 162
know 12
but 82
I 4330
nothing 5
of 110
his 43
going 3
when 6
I 4330
was 93
at 272
I 4330
hope 16
your 4
in 2719
favour 4

Mr 5
If 8

I 4330
have 11
no 896

a 6804
sense 8
of 110
great 12
ill 84
usage 3

most 3
painful 6
at 272
his 43

what 14

His 43
father 12
Miss 71
Bennet 4

the 193

His 43

I 4330
believe 6
I 4330
forgive 8
him 9
anything 3
and 51
than 22
his 43
the 193
and 51
the 193

his 43

and 51
with 34
all 162

and 51
of 110
the 193

with 34
gentle 19
but 82
It 67
was 93
the 193
prospect 13
of 110
constant 7

good 28
he 963
was 93
my 90
chief 14
inducement 3
to 805
enter 23
the 193

I 4330
it 67
to 805
be 1204

my 90

by 57
his 43
account 14
of 110

I 4330
have 11
a 6804
man 342
and 51
my 90
will 40
not 85
bear 30
I 4330
must 28
have 11
employment 3
and 51
A 6804
life 44
is 124
not 85
what 14
I 4330
was 93
intended 3
for 485
but 82
have 11
now 10
made 13
it 67
The 193
church 21
to 805
have 11
my 90
profession 14
I 4330
was 93
up 194
for 485
the 193
church 21
and 51
I 4330
should 7
at 272
this 6
time 45
have 11
in 2719
possession 3
of 110
a 6804
most 3
valuable 3
living 5
had 11
it 67
the 193
gentleman 4
we 445
were 5
of 110
just 24
now 10
Yes 16
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
me 1042
the 193
presentation 3
of 110
the 193
best 37
living 5
in 2719
his 43
gift 5
He 963
was 93
my 90
godfather 3
and 51
to 805
me 1042
I 4330
do 814
justice 3
to 805
his 43
kindness 3
He 963
meant 3
to 805
provide 13
for 485
me 1042
and 51
thought 11
he 963
had 11
done 3
it 67
but 82
when 6
the 193
living 5
fell 22
it 67
was 93
given 3
Good 28
Elizabeth 5
but 82
how 27
that 11
be 1204
How 27
his 43
will 40
be 1204
Why 4
did 23
you 29
not 85
seek 6
legal 21
redress 5
There 21
was 93
just 24
an 971
in 2719
the 193
of 110
the 193
bequest 3
as 509
to 805
give 15
me 1042
no 896
hope 16
law 45
A 6804
man 342
of 110
honour 3
not 85
have 11
the 193
intention 5
but 82
Mr 5
to 805
doubt 15
it 67
or 333
to 805
treat 15
it 67
as 509
a 6804
conditional 4
recommendation 3
and 51
to 805
assert 11
that 11
I 4330
had 11
all 162
claim 12
to 805
it 67
by 57
extravagance 3
in 2719
short 62
anything 3
or 333
nothing 5
Certain 5
it 67
is 124
that 11
the 193
living 5
two 14
ago 15
as 509
I 4330
was 93
of 110
an 971
age 24
to 805
hold 22
it 67
and 51
that 11
it 67
was 93
given 3
to 805
man 342
and 51
no 896
less 19
certain 5
is 124
it 67
that 11
I 4330
accuse 6
of 110
done 3
anything 3
to 805
deserve 4
to 805
lose 5
it 67
I 4330
have 11
a 6804
warm 23
temper 22
and 51
I 4330
may 49
have 11
my 90
opinion 4
of 110
him 9
and 51
to 805
him 9
too 50
I 4330
can 288
recall 5
nothing 5
worse 6
But 82
the 193
fact 35
is 124
that 11
we 445
are 12
different 11
sort 14
of 110
men 140
and 51
that 11
he 963
me 1042
This 6
is 124
He 963
to 805
be 1204
Some 30
time 45
or 333
other 6
he 963
will 40
be 1204
but 82
it 67
shall 12
not 85
be 1204
by 57
me 1042
Till 14
I 4330
can 288
forget 8
his 43
father 12
I 4330
can 288
never 3
or 333
expose 4
him 9
Elizabeth 5
him 9
for 485
and 51
thought 11
him 9
than 22
ever 33
as 509
he 963
them 9
But 82
what 14
she 199
after 48
a 6804
pause 4
can 288
have 11
his 43
motive 4
What 14
can 288
have 11
him 9
to 805
behave 3
so 797
A 6804
thorough 13
dislike 4
of 110
me 1042
a 6804
dislike 4
I 4330
but 82
attribute 4
in 2719
some 30
measure 8
to 805
Had 11
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
me 1042
less 19
his 43
son 70
might 9
have 11
borne 3
with 34
me 1042
better 7
but 82
his 43
uncommon 6
attachment 3
to 805
me 1042
him 9
I 4330
believe 6
in 2719
life 44
He 963
had 11
not 85
a 6804
temper 22
to 805
bear 30
the 193
sort 14
of 110
competition 3
in 2719
we 445
the 193
sort 14
of 110
preference 3
was 93
often 4
given 3
me 1042
I 4330
had 11
not 85
thought 11
Mr 5
so 797
bad 33
as 509
this 6
though 12
I 4330
have 11
never 3
him 9
I 4330
had 11
not 85
thought 11
so 797
ill 84
of 110
him 9
I 4330
had 11
him 9
to 805
be 1204
his 43
fellow 9
in 2719
general 22
but 82
did 23
not 85
suspect 5
him 9
of 110
to 805
malicious 4
revenge 6
injustice 3
as 509
this 6
After 48
a 6804
few 6
reflection 3
she 199
I 4330
do 814
remember 4
his 43
one 19
day 27
at 272
of 110
the 193
of 110
his 43
of 110
his 43
an 971
temper 22
His 43
disposition 3
must 28
be 1204
dreadful 4
I 4330
will 40
not 85
trust 26
on 86
the 193
subject 11
I 4330
can 288
be 1204
just 24
to 805
him 9
Elizabeth 5
was 93
deep 12
in 2719
thought 11
and 51
after 48
a 6804
time 45
To 805
treat 15
in 2719
a 6804
manner 8
the 193
godson 3
the 193
friend 14
the 193
of 110
his 43
father 12
She 199
have 11
A 6804
young 9
man 342
too 50
like 22
you 29
countenance 4
may 49
vouch 11
for 485
your 4
being 3
but 82
she 199
contented 4
with 34
and 51
one 19
too 50
who 79
had 11
his 43
companion 10
childhood 3
together 3
as 509
I 4330
think 8
you 29
in 2719
the 193
manner 8
We 445
were 5
born 4
in 2719
the 193
same 5
parish 6
within 3
the 193
same 5
park 18
the 193
part 102
of 110
our 3
youth 7
was 93
together 3
of 110
the 193
same 5
house 87
the 193
same 5
of 110
the 193
same 5
care 47
My 90
father 12
life 44
in 2719
the 193
profession 14
your 4
uncle 18
Mr 5
Phillips 3
to 805
do 814
so 797
credit 12
to 805
but 82
he 963
gave 4
up 194
to 805
be 1204
of 110
use 18
to 805
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
and 51
all 162
his 43
time 45
to 805
the 193
care 47
of 110
the 193
He 963
was 93
most 3
by 57
Mr 5
a 6804
most 3
intimate 5
confidential 4
friend 14
Mr 5
often 4
to 805
be 1204
under 288
the 193
to 805
my 90
active 6
and 51
when 6
my 90
death 19
Mr 5
gave 4
him 9
a 6804
promise 4
of 110
for 485
me 1042
I 4330
am 393
that 11
he 963
felt 5
it 67
to 805
be 1204
as 509
a 6804
debt 6
of 110
to 805
him 9
as 509
of 110
his 43
affection 5
to 805
How 27
strange 8
Elizabeth 5
How 27
I 4330
wonder 17
that 11
the 193
pride 6
of 110
this 6
Mr 5
has 41
not 85
made 13
him 9
just 24
to 805
you 29
If 8
no 896
better 7
motive 4
that 11
he 963
should 7
not 85
have 11
too 50
proud 5
to 805
be 1204
dishonest 4
for 485
I 4330
must 28
call 57
it 67
It 67
is 124
wonderful 4
for 485
all 162
his 43
may 49
be 1204
to 805
pride 6
and 51
pride 6
had 11
often 4
his 43
best 37
friend 14
It 67
has 41
him 9
with 34
virtue 3
than 22
with 34
any 17
other 6
feeling 4
But 82
we 445
are 12
none 32
of 110
us 70
and 51
in 2719
his 43
to 805
me 1042
there 21
were 5
even 36
than 22
pride 6
Can 288
pride 6
as 509
his 43
have 11
ever 33
done 3
him 9
good 28
Yes 16
It 67
has 41
often 4
led 11
him 9
to 805
be 1204
liberal 17
and 51
generous 4
to 805
give 15
his 43
money 17
to 805
display 6
to 805
assist 10
his 43
and 51
relieve 6
the 193
poor 11
pride 6
and 51
pride 6
for 485
he 963
is 124
proud 5
of 110
what 14
his 43

Not 85

the 193
influence 4
of 110
the 193
House 87

a 6804
motive 4
He 963
has 41
also 3
pride 6
with 34
some 30
affection 5
makes 4
him 9
a 6804
kind 31
and 51
careful 6
guardian 5
of 110
his 43
sister 10
and 51
you 29
will 40
hear 76
him 9
up 194
as 509
the 193
most 3
attentive 4
and 51
best 37
of 110
What 14

Mr 5
No 896
I 4330

not 85
I 4330
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
of 110
Lady 18
I 4330
never 3
of 110
her 182
existence 3
till 14
the 193
day 27
yesterday 3
Her 182
daughter 4
Miss 71
de 2453
will 40
have 11
a 6804
large 11
fortune 8
and 51
it 67
is 124
that 11
she 199
and 51
her 182
cousin 3
will 40
unite 4
the 193
two 14
This 6
information 3
made 13
Elizabeth 5
smile 7
as 509
she 199
thought 11
of 110
poor 11
Miss 71
Vain 8
must 28
be 1204
all 162
her 182
vain 8
and 51
useless 4
her 182
affection 5
for 485
his 43
sister 10
and 51
her 182
praise 7
of 110
if 8
he 963
were 5
self 11
for 485
Mr 5
she 199
both 8
of 110
Lady 18
and 51
her 182
daughter 4
but 82
some 30
that 11
he 963
has 41
related 3
of 110
her 182
ladyship 3
I 4330
suspect 5
his 43
him 9
and 51
that 11
in 2719
spite 10
of 110
her 182
being 3
his 43
patroness 3
she 199
is 124
an 971
conceited 4
woman 21
I 4330
believe 6
her 182
to 805
be 1204
both 8
in 2719
a 6804
great 12
degree 3
I 4330
have 11
not 85
her 182
for 485
but 82
I 4330
well 24
remember 4
that 11
I 4330
never 3
her 182
and 51
that 11
her 182
were 5
and 51
She 199
has 41
the 193
reputation 3
of 110
being 3
sensible 3
and 51
clever 6
but 82
I 4330
believe 6
she 199
part 102
of 110
her 182
her 182
rank 19
and 51
fortune 8
part 102
her 182
authoritative 4
manner 8
and 51
the 193
rest 110
the 193
pride 6
for 485
her 182
nephew 3
who 79
that 11
with 34
him 9
should 7
have 11
an 971
understanding 4
of 110
the 193
first 8
class 44
Elizabeth 5
that 11
he 963
had 11
given 3

account 14
of 110

and 51
they 5
together 3
with 34
mutual 4
satisfaction 3
till 14
supper 4
put 47
an 971
end 93
to 805

and 51
gave 4

Elizabeth 5
with 34
her 182
head 140
full 16
of 110
him 9
She 199
think 8
of 110
nothing 5
but 82
of 110
Mr 5
and 51
of 110
what 14
he 963
had 11

but 82
there 21

so 797
of 110

the 193
of 110
a 6804
young 9

as 509
The 193
of 110
his 43

all 162
her 182
tender 27
and 51
nothing 5

done 3
but 82
to 805
think 8
well 24
of 110
them 9
both 8
to 805
defend 10
the 193
conduct 21
of 110
and 51
throw 14
into 26
the 193
account 14
of 110
accident 7
or 333
mistake 5
not 85
be 1204
They 5
have 11
both 8
she 199
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
in 2719
some 30
way 27
or 333
other 6
of 110
we 445
can 288
form 68
no 896
idea 21
people 4
have 11
to 805
the 193
other 6
It 67
is 124
in 2719
short 62
for 485
us 70
to 805
conjecture 4
the 193
or 333
may 49
have 11
them 9
actual 11
blame 12
on 86
side 74
true 9
and 51
now 10
my 90
dear 15
Jane 9
what 14
have 11
you 29
got 14
to 805
say 7
on 86
of 110
the 193
people 4
who 79
have 11
in 2719
the 193
business 13
Do 814
clear 23
them 9
too 50
or 333
we 445
shall 12
be 1204
to 805
think 8
ill 84
of 110
Laugh 14
as 509
as 509
you 29
choose 5
but 82
you 29
will 40
not 85
laugh 14
me 1042
out 365
of 110
my 90
opinion 4
My 90
do 814
but 82
consider 13
in 2719
what 14
a 6804
disgraceful 4
light 42
it 67
Mr 5
to 805
be 1204
his 43
in 2719
a 6804
manner 8
one 19
whom 3
his 43
father 12
had 11
to 805
provide 13
for 485
It 67
is 124
No 896
man 342
of 110
common 23
no 896
man 342
who 79
had 11
any 17
value 8
for 485
his 43
character 16
be 1204
of 110
it 67
Can 288
his 43
most 3
intimate 5
friends 4
be 1204
so 797
in 2719
him 9
Oh 17
no 896
I 4330
can 288
more 11
believe 6
Mr 5
being 3
on 86
than 22
that 11
Mr 5
should 7
invent 19
a 6804
of 110
as 509
he 963
gave 4
me 1042
last 7
night 61
names 4
If 8
it 67
be 1204
not 85
so 797
let 50
Mr 5
contradict 8
it 67
there 21
was 93
truth 7
in 2719
his 43
It 67
is 124
difficult 5
it 67
is 124
One 19
does 5
not 85
know 12
what 14
to 805
think 8
I 4330
beg 59
your 4
pardon 10
one 19
what 14
to 805
think 8
But 82
Jane 9
think 8
with 34
on 86
one 19
point 22
that 11
Mr 5
if 8
he 963
had 11
on 86
would 5
have 11
to 805
suffer 11
when 6
the 193
affair 3
public 18
The 193
two 14
young 9
were 5
the 193
where 21
this 6
conversation 8
by 57
the 193

give 15
personal 13
invitation 6
for 485
the 193

the 193
following 3
Tuesday 3
The 193

were 5
to 805
see 70
dear 15
friend 14
it 67
an 971
age 24
since 7
they 5
had 11
met 180
and 51
what 14
she 199
had 11
doing 3
with 34
since 7
separation 3
To 805
the 193
rest 110
of 110
the 193

little 6
attention 3
Bennet 4
as 509
as 509
possible 3
saying 3
not 85
to 805
Elizabeth 5
and 51
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
to 805
the 193
They 5
were 5
soon 3
gone 4
rising 3
with 34
an 971
brother 9
by 57
surprise 4
and 51
off 101
as 509
if 8
eager 6
to 805
escape 10
The 193
prospect 13
of 110
the 193

was 93
agreeable 3
to 805
every 10
female 5
of 110
the 193
Bennet 4
to 805
consider 13
it 67
as 509

and 51
was 93
by 57

Jane 9
to 805
a 6804
evening 3
in 2719
the 193
of 110
her 182
two 14
friends 4
and 51
the 193
of 110
brother 9
and 51
Elizabeth 5
thought 11
with 34
pleasure 5
of 110
a 6804
great 12
deal 13
with 34
Mr 5
and 51
of 110
a 6804

for 485
though 12
they 5
like 22
Elizabeth 5
meant 3
to 805

half 23
the 193
evening 3
with 34
Mr 5
he 963
was 93
by 57
no 896
the 193
partner 8
who 79
satisfy 3
them 9
and 51
a 6804
ball 77
was 93
at 272
any 17
rate 9
a 6804
ball 77
And 51
even 36
Mary 13
assure 6
her 182
that 11
she 199
had 11
no 896
for 485
it 67
While 4
I 4330
can 288
have 11
my 90
to 805
she 199
it 67
is 124
I 4330

all 162
and 51
I 4330
profess 27
one 19
of 110
who 79
consider 13
of 110
recreation 4
and 51
amusement 3
as 509
desirable 3
for 485
were 5
so 797
high 54
on 86
this 6
occasion 7
that 11
though 12
she 199
did 23
not 85
often 4
speak 12
to 805
Mr 5
she 199
not 85
help 23
him 9
he 963
intended 3
to 805
accept 16
Mr 5
invitation 6
and 51
if 8
he 963
did 23
he 963
would 5
think 8
it 67
proper 9
to 805
join 16
in 2719
the 193
amusement 3
and 51
she 199
was 93
to 805
find 10
that 11
he 963
no 896
scruple 4
on 86
that 11
head 140
and 51
was 93
far 91
a 6804
rebuke 4

I 4330
assure 6
you 29
he 963
that 11
a 6804
ball 77
of 110
this 6
kind 31
given 3
by 57
a 6804
young 9
man 342
of 110
character 16
to 805
people 4
can 288
have 11
any 17
evil 15
and 51
I 4330
am 393
so 797
far 91
to 805
that 11
I 4330
shall 12
hope 16
to 805
be 1204
with 34
the 193
hands 24
of 110
all 162
my 90
fair 25
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 110
the 193
evening 3
and 51
I 4330
take 18
this 6
of 110
yours 3
Miss 71
Elizabeth 5
for 485
the 193
two 14
first 8
a 6804
preference 3
I 4330
trust 26
my 90
cousin 3
Jane 9
will 40
attribute 4
to 805
the 193
right 31
cause 14
and 51
not 85
to 805
any 17
disrespect 7
for 485
her 182
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
in 2719
She 199
had 11
being 3
by 57
Mr 5
for 485
and 51
to 805
have 11
Mr 5
her 182
had 11
never 3
worse 6
There 21
was 93
no 896
help 23
for 485
it 67
Mr 5
and 51
her 182
own 9
were 5
a 6804
little 6
and 51
Mr 5
proposal 3
with 34
as 509
good 28
a 6804
grace 14
as 509
she 199
She 199
was 93
not 85
the 193
better 7
with 34
his 43
the 193
idea 21
it 67
of 110
something 3
more 11
It 67
now 10
first 8
her 182
that 11
she 199
was 93
her 182
as 509
of 110
being 3
mistress 3
of 110
Parsonage 3
and 51
of 110
to 805
form 68
a 6804
quadrille 3
table 27
at 272
in 2719
the 193
absence 3
of 110
more 11
The 193
idea 21
soon 3
to 805
conviction 3
as 509
she 199
his 43
and 51
his 43
frequent 9
attempt 5
at 272
a 6804
compliment 6
on 86
her 182
wit 77
and 51
and 51
though 12
more 11
than 22
by 57
this 6
effect 15
of 110
her 182
it 67
was 93
not 85
long 50
her 182
mother 21
gave 4
her 182
to 805
understand 8
that 11
the 193
of 110
marriage 6
was 93
agreeable 3
to 805
her 182
Elizabeth 5
did 23
not 85
choose 5
to 805
take 18
the 193
hint 13
being 3
well 24
aware 3
that 11
a 6804
serious 4
dispute 7
must 28
be 1204
the 193
consequence 3
of 110
any 17
reply 3
Mr 5
might 9
never 3
make 17
the 193
offer 10
and 51
till 14
he 963
did 23
it 67
was 93
useless 4
to 805
quarrel 11
him 9
If 8
there 21
had 11
not 85
a 6804
ball 77
to 805
prepare 5
for 485
and 51
talk 18
of 110
the 193
Miss 71
would 5
have 11
in 2719
a 6804
state 41
at 272
this 6
time 45
for 485
the 193
day 27
of 110

Mr 5
the 193
cluster 5
of 110
red 211
there 21
a 6804
doubt 15
of 110
his 43
being 3
present 20
had 11
never 3
to 805
her 182
The 193
of 110
meeting 6
him 9
had 11
not 85
by 57
any 17
of 110
that 11
might 9
not 85
have 11
her 182
She 199
had 11
with 34
more 11
than 22
usual 3
care 47
and 51
prepared 3
in 2719
the 193
for 485
the 193
conquest 3
of 110
all 162
that 11
of 110
his 43
heart 57
that 11
it 67
was 93
not 85
more 11
than 22
might 9
be 1204
won 33
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 110
the 193
evening 3
But 82
in 2719
an 971
instant 11
the 193
dreadful 4
suspicion 3
of 110
his 43
being 3
for 485
Mr 5
pleasure 5
in 2719
the 193
invitation 6
to 805
the 193
and 51
though 12
this 6
was 93
not 85
the 193
case 25
the 193
absolute 7
fact 35
of 110
his 43
absence 3
was 93
by 57
his 43
friend 14
to 805
whom 3
Lydia 5
and 51
who 79
them 9
that 11
had 11
to 805
go 500
to 805
town 27
on 86
business 13
the 193
day 27
and 51
was 93
not 85
yet 4
with 34
a 6804
smile 7
I 4330
do 814
not 85
imagine 3
his 43
business 13
would 5
have 11
him 9
just 24
now 10
if 8
he 963
had 11
not 85
to 805
avoid 8
a 6804
certain 5
gentleman 4
here 31
This 6
part 102
of 110
his 43
though 12
by 57
Lydia 5
was 93
by 57
Elizabeth 5
and 51
as 509
it 67
assured 4
her 182
that 11
was 93
not 85
less 19
for 485
absence 3
than 22
if 8
her 182
first 8
surmise 4
had 11
just 24
every 10
feeling 4
of 110
the 193
former 3
was 93
so 797
by 57
immediate 4
disappointment 3
that 11
she 199
reply 3

to 805
the 193

Attendance 3
with 34
was 93
to 805
She 199
was 93
any 17
sort 14
of 110
conversation 8
with 34
him 9
and 51
with 34
a 6804
degree 3
of 110
ill 84
she 199
not 85
surmount 5
even 36
in 2719
to 805
Mr 5
Bingley 3
blind 22
her 182
But 82
Elizabeth 5
was 93
not 85
for 485
ill 84
and 51
though 12
every 10
prospect 13
of 110
her 182
own 9
was 93
for 485
the 193
evening 3
it 67
not 85
dwell 8
long 50
on 86
her 182
and 51
all 162
her 182
to 805
Charlotte 4
Lucas 3
whom 3
she 199
had 11
not 85
for 485
a 6804
week 20
she 199
was 93
soon 3
able 3
to 805
make 17
a 6804
transition 7
to 805
the 193
of 110
her 182
cousin 3
and 51
to 805
point 22
him 9
out 365
to 805
her 182
particular 13
notice 8
The 193
first 8
two 14
a 6804
return 14
of 110
distress 7
they 5
were 5
of 110
Mr 5
awkward 6
and 51
solemn 21
of 110
and 51
often 4
wrong 24
being 3
aware 3
of 110
it 67
gave 4
her 182
all 162
the 193
shame 14
and 51
a 6804
disagreeable 3
partner 8
for 485
a 6804
couple 7
of 110
can 288
give 15
The 193
moment 15
of 110
her 182
release 4
him 9
was 93
She 199
with 34
an 971
officer 4
and 51
had 11
the 193
refreshment 4
of 110
of 110
and 51
of 110
hearing 3
that 11
he 963
was 93
When 6
were 5
over 597
she 199
to 805
Charlotte 4
Lucas 3
and 51
was 93
in 2719
conversation 8
with 34
her 182
when 6
she 199
found 18
by 57
Mr 5
who 79
her 182
so 797
by 57
surprise 4
in 2719
his 43
application 3
for 485
her 182
hand 137
that 11
knowing 3
what 14
she 199
did 23
she 199
him 9
He 963
and 51
she 199
was 93
left 19
to 805
fret 14
over 597
her 182
own 9
want 13
of 110
presence 3
of 110
mind 25
Charlotte 4
to 805
console 4
her 182
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
you 29
will 40
find 10
him 9
agreeable 3
Heaven 9
forbid 6
That 11
would 5
be 1204
the 193
misfortune 3
of 110
all 162
To 805
find 10
a 6804
man 342
agreeable 3
whom 3
one 19
is 124
to 805
hate 14
Do 814
not 85
wish 13
me 1042
an 971
evil 15
When 6
the 193
and 51
to 805
claim 12
her 182
hand 137
Charlotte 4
not 85
help 23
her 182
in 2719
a 6804
whisper 8
not 85
to 805
be 1204
a 6804
simpleton 3
and 51
allow 9
her 182
fancy 5
for 485
to 805
make 17
her 182
appear 7
unpleasant 4
in 2719
the 193
eyes 8
of 110
a 6804
man 342
ten 151
times 10
his 43
consequence 3
Elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
her 182
place 29
in 2719
the 193
set 40
at 272
the 193
to 805
she 199
was 93
in 2719
being 3
to 805
stand 42
opposite 4
to 805
Mr 5
and 51
reading 3
in 2719
her 182
equal 17
in 2719
it 67
They 5
for 485
some 30
time 45
a 6804
word 26
and 51
she 199
to 805
imagine 3
that 11
silence 7
was 93
to 805
last 7
through 4
the 193
two 14
and 51
at 272
first 8
was 93
not 85
to 805
break 43
it 67
till 14
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1204
the 193
punishment 3
to 805
her 182
partner 8
to 805
oblige 3
him 9
to 805
talk 18
she 199
made 13
some 30
slight 11
observation 4
on 86
the 193
dance 7
He 963
and 51
was 93
silent 6
After 48
a 6804
pause 4
of 110
some 30
minutes 3
she 199
him 9
a 6804
second 16
time 45
with 34
It 67
is 124
your 4
turn 46
to 805
say 7
something 3
now 10
Mr 5
I 4330
the 193
dance 7
and 51
you 29
to 805
make 17
some 30
sort 14
of 110
remark 9
on 86
the 193
size 5
of 110
the 193
room 22
or 333
the 193
number 8
of 110
He 963
and 51
assured 4
her 182
that 11
she 199
him 9
to 805
say 7
should 7
be 1204
well 24
That 11
reply 3
will 40
do 814
for 485
the 193
present 20
by 57
and 51
by 57
I 4330
may 49
observe 6
that 11
private 9
balls 7
are 12
than 22
public 18
But 82
now 10
we 445
may 49
be 1204
silent 6
Do 814
you 29
talk 18
by 57
rule 7
then 5
while 4
you 29
are 12
One 19
must 28
speak 12
a 6804
little 6
you 29
know 12
It 67
would 5
look 14
odd 17
to 805
be 1204
silent 6
for 485
half 23
an 971
hour 10
together 3
and 51
yet 4
for 485
the 193
advantage 6
of 110
some 30
conversation 8
to 805
be 1204
so 797
as 509
that 11
they 5
may 49
have 11
the 193
trouble 18
of 110
saying 3
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
Are 12
you 29
your 4
own 9
in 2719
the 193
present 20
case 25
or 333
do 814
you 29
imagine 3
that 11
you 29
are 12
mine 26
Both 8
Elizabeth 5
for 485
I 4330
have 11
a 6804
great 12
in 2719
the 193
turn 46
of 110
our 3
minds 4
We 445
are 12
of 110
an 971
taciturn 4
disposition 3
unwilling 4
to 805
speak 12
we 445
expect 20
to 805
say 7
something 3
that 11
will 40
amaze 6
the 193
whole 26
room 22
and 51
be 1204
down 90
to 805
with 34
all 162
the 193
clat 6
of 110
a 6804
proverb 5
This 6
is 124
no 896
striking 3
resemblance 3
of 110
your 4
own 9
character 16
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
he 963
How 27
near 15
it 67
may 49
be 1204
to 805
mine 26
I 4330
pretend 7
to 805
say 7
You 29
think 8
it 67
a 6804
faithful 6
portrait 8
I 4330
must 28
not 85
decide 6
on 86
my 90
own 9
performance 3
He 963
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
they 5
were 5
silent 6
till 14
they 5
had 11
gone 4
down 90
the 193
dance 7
when 6
he 963
her 182
if 8
she 199
and 51
her 182
did 23
not 85
often 4
walk 25
to 805
She 199
in 2719
the 193
affirmative 4
and 51
to 805
resist 17
the 193
temptation 3
When 6
you 29
met 180
us 70
there 21
the 193
other 6
day 27
we 445
had 11
just 24
a 6804
new 115
acquaintance 5
The 193
effect 15
was 93
immediate 4
A 6804
shade 4
of 110
overspread 3
his 43
but 82
he 963
not 85
a 6804
word 26
and 51
Elizabeth 5
though 12
for 485
her 182
own 9
weakness 3
not 85
go 500
on 86
At 272
length 14
spoke 14
and 51
in 2719
a 6804
manner 8
Mr 5
is 124
blessed 4
with 34
as 509
may 49
ensure 6
his 43
making 4
friends 4
he 963
may 49
be 1204
of 110
them 9
is 124
less 19
certain 5
He 963
has 41
so 797
as 509
to 805
lose 5
your 4
friendship 3
Elizabeth 5
with 34
and 51
in 2719
a 6804
manner 8
he 963
is 124
to 805
suffer 11
all 162
his 43
life 44
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
of 110
the 193
subject 11
At 272
that 11
moment 15
Sir 22
William 4
Lucas 3
close 22
to 805
them 9
meaning 11
to 805
pass 66
through 4
the 193
set 40
to 805
the 193
other 6
side 74
of 110
the 193
room 22
but 82
on 86
Mr 5
he 963
with 34
a 6804
bow 58
of 110
superior 5
to 805
compliment 6
him 9
on 86
his 43
and 51
his 43
partner 8
I 4330
have 11
most 3
my 90
dear 15
sir 22
superior 5
is 124
not 85
often 4
It 67
is 124
that 11
you 29
belong 6
to 805
the 193
first 8
Allow 9
me 1042
to 805
say 7
that 11
your 4
fair 25
partner 8
does 5
not 85
disgrace 8
you 29
and 51
that 11
I 4330
must 28
hope 16
to 805
have 11
this 6
pleasure 5
often 4
when 6
a 6804
certain 5
desirable 3
event 18
my 90
dear 15
Eliza 7
at 272
her 182
sister 10
and 51
Bingley 3
shall 12
take 18
place 29
What 14
will 40
then 5
flow 27
in 2719
I 4330
appeal 6
to 805
Mr 5
but 82
let 50
me 1042
not 85
interrupt 11
you 29
sir 22
You 29
will 40
not 85
thank 15
me 1042
for 485
you 29
the 193
converse 5
of 110
that 11
young 9
lady 18
bright 17
eyes 8
are 12
also 3
me 1042
The 193
latter 3
part 102
of 110
this 6
address 9
was 93
by 57
but 82
Sir 22
allusion 3
to 805
his 43
friend 14
to 805
strike 14
him 9
and 51
his 43
eyes 8
were 5
with 34
a 6804
serious 4
expression 11
Bingley 3
and 51
Jane 9
who 79
were 5
together 3
he 963
to 805
his 43
partner 8
and 51
Sir 22
interruption 3
has 41
made 13
me 1042
forget 8
what 14
we 445
were 5
of 110
I 4330
do 814
not 85
think 8
we 445
were 5
at 272
all 162
Sir 22
William 4
not 85
have 11
two 14
people 4
in 2719
the 193
room 22
who 79
had 11
less 19
to 805
say 7
for 485
We 445
have 11
two 14
or 333
three 12
success 13
and 51
what 14
we 445
are 12
to 805
talk 18
of 110
I 4330
imagine 3
What 14
think 8
you 29
of 110
books 15
he 963
Books 15
oh 17
no 896
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
we 445
never 3
read 49
the 193
same 5
or 333
not 85
with 34
the 193
same 5
I 4330
am 393
you 29
think 8
so 797
but 82
if 8
that 11
be 1204
the 193
case 25
there 21
can 288
at 272
least 3
be 1204
no 896
want 13
of 110
subject 11
We 445
may 49
compare 4
our 3
different 11
No 896
I 4330
talk 18
of 110
books 15
in 2719
a 6804
ball 77
room 22
my 90
head 140
is 124
full 16
of 110
something 3
The 193
present 20
you 29
in 2719
does 5
it 67
he 963
with 34
a 6804
look 14
of 110
doubt 15
Yes 16
she 199
knowing 3
what 14
she 199
for 485
her 182
had 11
far 91
the 193
subject 11
as 509
soon 3
by 57
her 182
I 4330
remember 4
hearing 3
you 29
say 7
Mr 5
that 11
you 29
ever 33
that 11
your 4
resentment 3
was 93
You 29
are 12
cautious 4
I 4330
suppose 4
as 509
to 805
being 3
I 4330
am 393
he 963
with 34
a 6804
firm 16
voice 8
And 51
never 3
allow 9
to 805
be 1204
by 57
prejudice 4
I 4330
hope 16
not 85
It 67
is 124
incumbent 3
on 86
who 79
never 3
change 21
opinion 4
to 805
be 1204
secure 6
of 110
at 272
first 8
May 49
I 4330
ask 6
to 805
what 14
these 4
tend 46
to 805
the 193
illustration 3
of 110
your 4
character 16
she 199
to 805
shake 19
off 101
her 182
I 4330
am 393
to 805
make 17
it 67
out 365
And 51
what 14
is 124
your 4
success 13
She 199
her 182
head 140
I 4330
do 814
not 85
get 13
on 86
at 272
all 162
I 4330
hear 76
different 11
of 110
you 29
as 509
puzzle 9
me 1042
I 4330
can 288
believe 6
he 963
that 11
may 49
with 34
respect 18
to 805
me 1042
and 51
I 4330
wish 13
Miss 71
Bennet 4
that 11
you 29
were 5
not 85
to 805
sketch 18
my 90
character 16
at 272
the 193
present 20
moment 15
as 509
there 21
is 124
reason 13
to 805
fear 14
that 11
the 193
performance 3
would 5
reflect 12
no 896
credit 12
on 86
But 82
if 8
I 4330
do 814
not 85
take 18
your 4
likeness 3
now 10
I 4330
may 49
never 3
have 11
I 4330
would 5
by 57
no 896
suspend 7
any 17
pleasure 5
of 110
yours 3
he 963
She 199
no 896
more 11
and 51
they 5
down 90
the 193
other 6
dance 7
and 51
in 2719
silence 7
and 51
on 86
side 74
though 12
not 85
to 805
an 971
equal 17
degree 3
for 485
in 2719
breast 21
there 21
was 93
a 6804
feeling 4
her 182
soon 3
her 182
pardon 10
and 51
all 162
his 43
anger 5
They 5
had 11
not 85
long 50
when 6
Miss 71
Bingley 3
came 36
her 182
and 51
with 34
an 971
expression 11
of 110
civil 15
disdain 7
her 182
So 797
Miss 71
Eliza 7
I 4330
hear 76
you 29
are 12
with 34
George 6
Your 4
sister 10
has 41
to 805
me 1042
him 9
and 51
me 1042
a 6804
thousand 7
and 51
I 4330
find 10
that 11
the 193
young 9
man 342
to 805
tell 16
you 29
his 43
other 6
communication 3
that 11
he 963
was 93
the 193
son 70
of 110
old 21
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
steward 10
Let 50
me 1042
recommend 8
you 29
as 509
a 6804
friend 14
not 85
to 805
give 15
implicit 4
confidence 3
to 805
all 162
his 43
for 485
as 509
to 805
Mr 5
him 9
ill 84
it 67
is 124
false 12
for 485
on 86
the 193
he 963
has 41
kind 31
to 805
him 9
though 12
George 6
has 41
Mr 5
in 2719
a 6804
most 3
manner 8
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
the 193
but 82
I 4330
know 12
well 24
that 11
Mr 5
is 124
not 85
in 2719
the 193
least 3
to 805
blame 12
that 11
he 963
bear 30
to 805
hear 76
George 6
and 51
that 11
though 12
my 90
brother 9
thought 11
that 11
he 963
not 85
well 24
avoid 8
him 9
in 2719
his 43
invitation 6
to 805
the 193
he 963
was 93
glad 30
to 805
find 10
that 11
he 963
had 11
out 365
of 110
the 193
way 27
His 43
coming 3
into 26
the 193
country 12
at 272
all 162
is 124
a 6804
most 3
thing 15
and 51
I 4330
wonder 17
how 27
he 963
presume 3
to 805
do 814
it 67
I 4330
pity 4
you 29
Miss 71
Eliza 7
for 485
this 6
of 110
your 4
guilt 9
but 82
his 43
descent 3
one 19
not 85
expect 20
better 7
His 43
guilt 9
and 51
his 43
descent 3
appear 7
by 57
your 4
account 14
to 805
be 1204
the 193
same 5
Elizabeth 5
for 485
I 4330
have 11
you 29
accuse 6
him 9
of 110
nothing 5
worse 6
than 22
of 110
being 3
the 193
son 70
of 110
Mr 5
steward 10
and 51
of 110
that 11
I 4330
can 288
assure 6
you 29
he 963
me 1042
I 4330
beg 59
your 4
pardon 10
Miss 71
Bingley 3
turning 3
with 34
a 6804
sneer 7
Excuse 4
my 90
it 67
was 93
meant 3
girl 14
Elizabeth 5
to 805
You 29
are 12
if 8
you 29
expect 20
to 805
influence 4
me 1042
by 57
a 6804
attack 8
as 509
this 6
I 4330
see 70
nothing 5
in 2719
it 67
but 82
your 4
own 9
and 51
the 193
of 110
Mr 5
She 199
then 5
her 182
sister 10
who 79
had 11
to 805
make 17
on 86
the 193
same 5
subject 11
of 110
Bingley 3
Jane 9
met 180
her 182
with 34
a 6804
smile 7
of 110
sweet 33
a 6804
glow 14
of 110
expression 11
as 509
how 27
well 24
she 199
was 93
with 34
the 193
of 110
the 193
evening 3
Elizabeth 5
read 49
her 182
and 51
at 272
that 11
moment 15
for 485
resentment 3
his 43
and 51
gave 4
way 27
the 193
hope 16
of 110
being 3
in 2719
the 193
way 27
for 485
I 4330
want 13
to 805
know 12
she 199
with 34
a 6804
countenance 4
no 896
less 19
than 22
her 182
what 14
you 29
have 11
Mr 5
But 82
you 29
have 11
too 50
to 805
think 8
of 110
any 17
third 4
person 33
in 2719
case 25
you 29
may 49
be 1204
sure 11
of 110
my 90
pardon 10
No 896
Jane 9
I 4330
have 11
not 85
him 9
but 82
I 4330
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
tell 16
you 29
Mr 5
Bingley 3
does 5
not 85
know 12
the 193
whole 26
of 110
his 43
and 51
is 124
of 110
the 193
have 11
Mr 5
but 82
he 963
will 40
vouch 11
for 485
the 193
good 28
conduct 21
the 193
and 51
honour 3
of 110
his 43
friend 14
and 51
is 124
that 11
Mr 5
has 41
less 19
attention 3
Mr 5
than 22
he 963
has 41
and 51
I 4330
am 393
to 805
say 7
by 57
his 43
account 14
as 509
well 24
as 509
his 43
Mr 5
is 124
by 57
no 896
a 6804
young 9
man 342
I 4330
am 393
he 963
has 41
and 51
has 41
to 805
lose 5
Mr 5
regard 7
Mr 5
Bingley 3
does 5
not 85
know 12
Mr 5
No 896
he 963
never 3
saw 24
him 9
till 14
the 193
other 6
morning 3
at 272
This 6
account 14
then 5
is 124
what 14
he 963
has 41
Mr 5
I 4330
am 393
But 82
what 14
does 5
he 963
say 7
of 110
the 193
living 5
He 963
does 5
not 85
recollect 7
the 193
though 12
he 963
has 41
them 9
Mr 5
more 11
than 22
but 82
he 963
that 11
it 67
was 93
left 19
to 805
him 9
I 4330
have 11
not 85
a 6804
doubt 15
of 110
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5
but 82
you 29
must 28
excuse 4
my 90
not 85
being 3
by 57
Mr 5
defense 8
of 110
his 43
friend 14
was 93
a 6804
able 3
one 19
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
but 82
since 7
he 963
is 124
with 34
several 3
of 110
the 193
story 13
and 51
has 41
the 193
rest 110
that 11
friend 14
I 4330
shall 12
venture 8
to 805
still 13
think 8
of 110
both 8
as 509
I 4330
did 23
She 199
then 5
the 193
discourse 4
to 805
one 19
more 11
to 805
and 51
on 86
there 21
be 1204
no 896
difference 3
of 110
sentiment 18
Elizabeth 5
with 34
delight 8
to 805
the 193
though 12
modest 5
Jane 9
of 110
Mr 5
regard 7
and 51
all 162
in 2719
her 182
power 19
to 805
heighten 4
her 182
confidence 3
in 2719
it 67
On 86
being 3
by 57
Mr 5
Bingley 3
Elizabeth 5
to 805
Miss 71
Lucas 3
to 805
after 48
the 193
of 110
her 182
last 7
partner 8

had 11
Mr 5
came 36
up 194
to 805
them 9
and 51
her 182
with 34
great 12
that 11
he 963
had 11
just 24
so 797
as 509
to 805
make 17
a 6804
most 3
I 4330
have 11
found 18
out 365
he 963
by 57
a 6804
singular 7
accident 7
that 11
there 21
is 124
now 10
in 2719
the 193
room 22
a 6804
near 15
relation 8
of 110
my 90
patroness 3
I 4330
to 805
overhear 5
the 193
gentleman 4
to 805
the 193
young 9
lady 18
who 79
does 5
the 193
of 110
the 193

of 110
his 43
cousin 3
Miss 71
de 2453
and 51
of 110
her 182
mother 21
Lady 18
How 27
these 4
sort 14
of 110
occur 7
Who 79
would 5
have 11
thought 11
of 110
my 90
meeting 6
with 34
a 6804
nephew 3
of 110
Lady 18
de 2453
in 2719
this 6
assembly 8
I 4330
am 393
most 3
thankful 4
that 11
the 193
is 124
made 13
in 2719
time 45
for 485
me 1042
to 805
pay 52
my 90
to 805
him 9
I 4330
am 393
now 10
going 3
to 805
do 814
and 51
trust 26
he 963
will 40
excuse 4
my 90
not 85
done 3
it 67
My 90
total 17
of 110
the 193
connection 3
must 28
plead 10
my 90
You 29
are 12
not 85
going 3
to 805
introduce 3
to 805
Mr 5
I 4330
am 393
I 4330
shall 12
entreat 8
his 43
pardon 10
for 485
not 85
done 3
it 67
I 4330
believe 6
him 9
to 805
be 1204
Lady 18
nephew 3
It 67
will 40
be 1204
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
assure 6
him 9
that 11
her 182
ladyship 3
was 93
well 24
yesterday 3
Elizabeth 5
hard 70
to 805
dissuade 3
him 9
a 6804
scheme 7
him 9
that 11
Mr 5
would 5
consider 13
his 43
him 9
introduction 3
as 509
an 971
freedom 3
than 22
a 6804
compliment 6
to 805
his 43
aunt 6
that 11
it 67
was 93
not 85
in 2719
the 193
least 3
there 21
should 7
be 1204
any 17
notice 8
on 86
side 74
and 51
that 11
if 8
it 67
were 5
it 67
must 28
belong 6
to 805
Mr 5
the 193
superior 5
in 2719
consequence 3
to 805
begin 8
the 193
acquaintance 5
Mr 5
to 805
her 182
with 34
the 193
air 129
of 110
following 3
his 43
own 9
inclination 3
and 51
when 6
she 199
My 90
dear 15
Miss 71
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
have 11
the 193
opinion 4
in 2719
the 193
world 12
in 2719
your 4
in 2719
all 162
within 3
the 193
scope 5
of 110
your 4
understanding 4
but 82
permit 5
me 1042
to 805
say 7
that 11
there 21
must 28
be 1204
a 6804
wide 15
difference 3
the 193
of 110
the 193
and 51
regulate 3
the 193
clergy 8
for 485
give 15
me 1042
leave 14
to 805
observe 6
that 11
I 4330
consider 13
the 193
clerical 4
office 12
as 509
equal 17
in 2719
point 22
of 110
with 34
the 193
rank 19
in 2719
the 193
kingdom 3
that 11
a 6804
proper 9
of 110
is 124
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
You 29
must 28
allow 9
me 1042
to 805
follow 11
the 193
of 110
my 90
conscience 4
on 86
this 6
occasion 7
me 1042
to 805
perform 10
what 14
I 4330
look 14
on 86
as 509
a 6804
point 22
of 110
Pardon 10
me 1042
for 485
to 805
profit 19
by 57
your 4
on 86
every 10
other 6
subject 11
shall 12
be 1204
my 90
constant 7
guide 16
though 12
in 2719
the 193
case 25
us 70
I 4330
consider 13
more 11
by 57
education 9
and 51
habitual 4
study 3
to 805
decide 6
on 86
what 14
is 124
right 31
than 22
a 6804
young 9
lady 18

And 51
with 34
a 6804

Her 182

though 12
she 199
not 85
hear 76
a 6804
word 26
of 110
it 67
she 199
felt 5
as 509
if 8
hearing 3
it 67
all 162
and 51
saw 24
in 2719
the 193
motion 9

with 34
an 971

me 1042
the 193
compliment 6
of 110
saying 3
that 11
he 963

so 797
well 24
of 110
Lady 18

compatible 3
with 34
the 193

can 288
be 1204
in 2719

to 805
do 814
In 2719
the 193
first 8

must 28
make 17
an 971

be 1204
to 805

out 365

her 182

she 199

run 50
with 34
by 57
my 90
on 86
this 6
subject 11
it 67
would 5
be 1204
for 485
me 1042
to 805
state 41
my 90
for 485
and 51
for 485
coming 3
into 26
with 34
the 193
design 16
of 110
a 6804
wife 6
as 509
I 4330
did 23
The 193
idea 21
of 110
Mr 5
with 34
all 162
his 43
solemn 21
being 3
run 50
with 34

short 62
pause 4
he 963
in 2719
any 17
attempt 5
to 805
stop 36
him 9
further 8
and 51
he 963
My 90
for 485
are 12
first 8
that 11
I 4330
think 8
it 67
a 6804
right 31
thing 15
for 485
every 10
in 2719
like 22
to 805
set 40
the 193
example 4
of 110
in 2719
his 43
parish 6
that 11
I 4330
am 393
that 11
it 67
will 40
add 54
to 805
my 90
and 51
I 4330
to 805
have 11
that 11
it 67
is 124
the 193
particular 13
and 51
recommendation 3
of 110
the 193
noble 13
lady 18
whom 3
I 4330
have 11
the 193
honour 4
of 110
calling 3
patroness 3
has 41
she 199
to 805
give 15
me 1042
her 182
opinion 4
too 50
on 86
this 6
subject 11
and 51
it 67
was 93
but 82
the 193
Saturday 3
night 61
I 4330
left 19
our 3
pools 3
at 272
quadrille 3
while 4
was 93
Miss 71
de 2453
footstool 3
that 11
she 199
you 29
must 28
A 6804
like 22
you 29
must 28
Choose 5
choose 5
a 6804
for 485
my 90
sake 3
and 51
for 485
your 4
own 9
let 50
her 182
be 1204
an 971
active 6
useful 4
sort 14
of 110
person 33
not 85
up 194
high 54
but 82
able 3
to 805
make 17
a 6804
small 14
income 5
go 500
a 6804
good 28
way 27
This 6
is 124
my 90
Find 10
a 6804
woman 21
as 509
soon 3
as 509
you 29
can 288
bring 6
her 182
to 805
and 51
I 4330
will 40
visit 14
her 182
' 7
Allow 9
me 1042
by 57
the 193
way 27
to 805
observe 6
my 90
fair 25
cousin 3
that 11
I 4330
do 814
not 85
reckon 6
the 193
notice 8
and 51
kindness 3
of 110
Lady 18
de 2453
as 509
the 193
least 3
of 110
the 193
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
offer 10
You 29
will 40
find 10
her 182
anything 3
I 4330
can 288
describe 6
and 51
your 4
wit 77
and 51
I 4330
think 8
must 28
be 1204
acceptable 3
to 805
her 182
when 6
with 34
the 193
silence 7
and 51
respect 18
her 182
rank 19
will 40
excite 10
for 485
my 90
general 22
intention 5
in 2719
favour 5
of 110
it 67
to 805
be 1204
why 4
my 90
were 5
of 110
my 90
own 9
where 21
I 4330
can 288
assure 6
you 29
there 21
are 12
young 9
women 5
But 82
the 193
fact 35
is 124
that 11
being 3
as 509
I 4330
am 393
to 805
inherit 11
this 6
estate 3
after 48
the 193
death 19
of 110
your 4
father 12
who 79
may 49
live 43
I 4330
not 85
satisfy 3
to 805
choose 5
a 6804
wife 6
his 43
that 11
the 193
loss 3
to 805
them 9
might 9
be 1204
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
when 6
the 193
event 18
place 29
as 509
I 4330
have 11
may 49
not 85
be 1204
for 485
several 3
This 6
has 41
my 90
motive 4
my 90
fair 25
cousin 3
and 51
I 4330
flatter 10
it 67
will 40
not 85
sink 13
me 1042
in 2719
your 4
esteem 5
And 51
now 10
nothing 5
for 485
me 1042
but 82
to 805
assure 6
you 29
in 2719
the 193
most 3
language 3
of 110
the 193
of 110
my 90
affection 5
To 805
fortune 8
I 4330
am 393
and 51
shall 12
make 17
no 896
demand 5
of 110
that 11
nature 4
on 86
your 4
father 12
since 7
I 4330
am 393
well 24
aware 3
that 11
it 67
not 85

with 34
and 51
that 11
one 19
thousand 7
in 2719
the 193
four 26
per 552
will 40
not 85
be 1204
yours 3
till 14
after 48
your 4
decease 5
is 124
all 162
that 11
you 29
may 49
ever 33
be 1204
to 805
On 86
that 11
head 140
I 4330
shall 12
be 1204
silent 6
and 51
you 29
may 49
assure 6
that 11
no 896
reproach 8
shall 12
ever 33
pass 66
my 90
lips 8
when 6
we 445
are 12
married 3
It 67
was 93
to 805
interrupt 11
him 9
now 10
You 29
are 12
too 50
sir 22
she 199
You 29
forget 8
that 11
I 4330
have 11
made 13
no 896
answer 8
Let 50
me 1042
do 814
it 67
further 8
loss 3
of 110
time 45
Accept 16
my 90
thanks 4
for 485
the 193
compliment 6
you 29
are 12

I 4330
am 393
sensible 3
of 110
the 193
honour 4
of 110
your 4
but 82
it 67
is 124
for 485
me 1042
to 805
do 814
than 22
to 805
decline 7
them 9
I 4330
am 393
not 85
now 10
to 805
learn 10
Mr 5
with 34
a 6804
formal 21
wave 23
of 110
the 193
hand 137
that 11
it 67
is 124
usual 3
with 34
young 9
to 805
reject 8
the 193
of 110
the 193
man 343
whom 3
they 5
mean 36
to 805
accept 16
when 6
he 963
first 8
for 485
favour 5
and 51
that 11
the 193
refusal 3
is 124
a 6804
second 16
or 333
even 36
a 6804
third 4
time 45
I 4330
am 393
by 57
no 896
by 57
what 14
you 29
have 11
just 24
and 51
shall 12
hope 16
to 805
lead 15
you 29
to 805
the 193
altar 6
ere 23
long 50
my 90
word 26
sir 22
Elizabeth 5
your 4
hope 16
is 124
a 6804
one 19
after 48
my 90
declaration 3
I 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
that 11
I 4330
am 393
not 85
one 19
of 110
young 9
if 8
young 9
there 21
are 12
who 79
are 12
so 797
daring 3
as 509
to 805
risk 11
on 86
the 193
chance 20
of 110
being 3
a 6804
second 16
time 45
I 4330
am 393
serious 4
in 2719
my 90
refusal 3
You 29
not 85
make 17
me 1042
and 51
I 4330
am 393
that 11
I 4330
am 393
the 193
last 7
woman 21
in 2719
the 193
world 12
who 79
make 17
you 29
so 797
Nay 6
were 5
your 4
friend 14
Lady 18
to 805
know 12
me 1042
I 4330
am 393
she 199
would 5
find 10
me 1042
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
ill 84
for 485
the 193
situation 3
Were 5
it 67
certain 5
that 11
Lady 18
would 5
think 8
so 797
Mr 5
but 82
I 4330
imagine 3
that 11
her 182
ladyship 3
would 5
at 272
all 162
disapprove 3
of 110
you 29
And 51
you 29
may 49
be 1204
certain 5
when 6
I 4330
have 11
the 193
honour 4
of 110
her 182
I 4330
shall 12
speak 12
in 2719
the 193
of 110
your 4
and 51
other 6
qualification 3
Mr 5
all 162
praise 7
of 110
me 1042
will 40
be 1204
You 29
must 28
give 15
me 1042
leave 14
to 805
judge 7
for 485
and 51
pay 52
me 1042
the 193
compliment 6
of 110
what 14
I 4330
say 7
I 4330
wish 13
you 29
and 51
rich 19
and 51
by 57
your 4
hand 137
do 814
all 162
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
prevent 13
your 4
being 3
In 2719
making 4
me 1042
the 193
offer 10
you 29
must 28
have 11
the 193
of 110
your 4
with 34
regard 7
to 805
my 90
and 51
may 49
take 18
possession 3
of 110
estate 3
it 67
any 17
self 11
reproach 8
This 6
matter 7
may 49
be 1204
as 509
And 51
rising 3
as 509
she 199
spoke 14
she 199
would 5
have 11
the 193
room 22
had 11
Mr 5
not 85
her 182
When 6
I 4330
do 814
the 193
honour 4
of 110
to 805
you 29
on 86
the 193
subject 11
I 4330
shall 12
hope 16
to 805
receive 8
a 6804
more 11
answer 8
than 22
you 29
have 11
now 10
given 3
me 1042
though 12
I 4330
am 393
far 91
you 29
of 110
at 272
present 20
I 4330
know 12
it 67
to 805
be 1204
the 193
custom 17
of 110
your 4
sex 45
to 805
reject 8
a 6804
man 343
on 86
the 193
first 8
application 3
and 51
you 29
have 11
even 36
now 10
as 509
to 805
encourage 6
my 90
suit 21
as 509
would 5
be 1204
with 34
the 193
true 9
of 110
the 193
female 5
character 16
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5
with 34
some 30
you 29
puzzle 9
me 1042
If 8
what 14
I 4330
have 11
can 288
appear 7
to 805
you 29
in 2719
the 193
form 68
of 110
encouragement 3
I 4330
know 12
not 85
how 27
to 805
express 25
my 90
refusal 3
in 2719
a 6804
way 27
as 509
to 805
convince 3
you 29
of 110
being 3
one 19
You 29
must 28
give 15
me 1042
leave 14
to 805
flatter 10
my 90
dear 15
cousin 3
that 11
your 4
refusal 3
of 110
my 90
is 124
words 5
of 110
course 10
My 90
for 485
it 67
are 12
these 4
It 67
does 5
not 85
appear 7
to 805
me 1042
that 11
my 90
hand 137
is 124
of 110
your 4
acceptance 3
or 333
that 11
the 193
establishment 3
I 4330
can 288
offer 10
would 5
be 1204
any 17
other 6
than 22
desirable 3
My 90
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
my 90
with 34
the 193
of 110
de 2453
and 51
my 90
relationship 3
to 805
your 4
own 9
are 12
in 2719
my 90
favour 5
and 51
you 29
should 7
take 18
it 67
into 26
further 8
consideration 3
that 11
in 2719
spite 10
of 110
your 4
manifold 5
it 67
is 124
by 57
no 896
certain 5
that 11
offer 10
of 110
marriage 6
may 49
ever 33
be 1204
made 13
you 29
Your 4
portion 5
is 124
so 797
small 14
that 11
it 67
will 40
in 2719
all 162
likelihood 3
undo 10
the 193
of 110
your 4
and 51
As 509
I 4330
must 28
conclude 3
that 11
you 29
are 12
not 85
serious 4
in 2719
your 4
rejection 3
of 110
me 1042
I 4330
shall 12
choose 5
to 805
attribute 4
it 67
to 805
your 4
wish 13
of 110
my 90
love 29
by 57
suspense 3
to 805
the 193
usual 3
practice 4
of 110
I 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
sir 22
that 11
I 4330
have 11
no 896
to 805
that 11
kind 31
of 110
in 2719
a 6804
man 343
I 4330
would 5
be 1204
the 193
compliment 6
of 110
being 3
sincere 4
I 4330
thank 15
you 29
and 51
for 485
the 193
honour 4
you 29
have 11
done 3
me 1042
in 2719
your 4
but 82
to 805
accept 16
them 9
is 124
My 90
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
forbid 6
it 67
Can 288
I 4330
speak 12
Do 814
not 85
consider 13
me 1042
now 10
as 509
an 971
female 5
to 805
plague 4
you 29
but 82
as 509
a 6804
rational 22
creature 3
the 193
truth 7
her 182
heart 57
You 29
are 12
he 963
with 34
an 971
air 129
of 110
awkward 6
and 51
I 4330
am 393
that 11
when 6
by 57
the 193
express 25
of 110
both 8
your 4
my 90
will 40
not 85
fail 12
of 110
being 3
acceptable 3
To 805
in 2719
self 11
deception 3
Elizabeth 5
would 5
make 17
no 896
reply 3
and 51
and 51
in 2719
silence 7
if 8
he 963
in 2719
her 182
as 509
encouragement 3
to 805
to 805
her 182
father 12
negative 7
might 9
be 1204
in 2719
a 6804
manner 8
as 509
to 805
be 1204
decisive 4
and 51
at 272
least 3
not 85
be 1204
for 485
the 193
affectation 3
and 51
of 110
an 971
female 5
Chapter 3
Mr 5
was 93
not 85
left 19
long 50
to 805
the 193

of 110
his 43

for 485
Bennet 4
in 2719

to 805
watch 35
for 485
the 193
end 94
of 110
the 193
conference 3
no 896
saw 24
Elizabeth 5
open 21
the 193
door 41
and 51
with 34
quick 25
step 48
pass 66
her 182

room 22

both 8
him 9
and 51
in 2719
warm 23
on 86
the 193
prospect 13
of 110
connection 3
Mr 5
and 51
these 4
with 34
equal 17
pleasure 5
and 51
then 5
to 805
relate 8
the 193
of 110
interview 11
with 34
the 193
result 8
of 110
he 963
he 963
had 11
every 10
reason 13
to 805
be 1204
since 7
the 193
refusal 3
his 43
cousin 3
had 11
given 3
him 9
would 5
flow 27
her 182
bashful 4
and 51
the 193
genuine 4
of 110
her 182
character 16
This 6
information 3
Bennet 4
she 199
would 5
have 11
glad 30
to 805
be 1204
that 11
her 182
daughter 4
had 11
meant 3
to 805
encourage 6
him 9
by 57
his 43
but 82
she 199
dared 6
not 85
believe 6
it 67
and 51
not 85
help 23
saying 3
so 797
But 82
depend 17
it 67
Mr 5
she 199
that 11
shall 12
be 1204
to 805
reason 13
I 4330
will 40
speak 12
to 805
her 182
it 67
She 199
is 124
a 6804
foolish 4
girl 14
and 51
does 5
not 85
know 12
her 182
own 9
interest 6
but 82
I 4330
will 40
make 17
her 182
know 12
it 67
Pardon 10
me 1042
for 485
you 29
madam 5
Mr 5
but 82
if 8
she 199
is 124
and 51
foolish 4
I 4330
know 12
not 85
she 199
would 5
be 1204
a 6804
desirable 3
wife 6
to 805
a 6804
man 343
in 2719
my 90
situation 3
who 79
for 485
in 2719
the 193
marriage 6
state 41
If 8
she 199
in 2719
my 90
suit 21
it 67
were 5
better 7
not 85
to 805
force 10
her 182
into 26

if 8
to 805

temper 22
she 199
not 85
contribute 3
to 805
my 90
Sir 22
you 29
misunderstand 5
me 1042
Bennet 4

In 2719
she 199
is 124

I 4330

we 445
shall 12
soon 3
settle 10
it 67
with 34
her 182
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
She 199
would 5
not 85
give 15
him 9
time 45

reply 3
but 82
to 805
her 182
husband 10
out 365
as 509
she 199
the 193
Oh 17

Bennet 4

all 162
in 2719

You 29

make 17
Mr 5
for 485
she 199

not 85
have 11
him 9
and 51
if 8
you 29
do 814
not 85

haste 8
he 963

change 21
his 43

Mr 5
Bennet 4

with 34
a 6804
calm 10
unconcern 4
was 93
not 85

Of 110

And 51
what 14
am 393
I 4330
to 805

on 86
the 193
occasion 7
It 67
an 971
hopeless 4
business 13
Speak 12

Tell 16
her 182
that 11

her 182

Let 50
her 182

She 199

hear 76
my 90

Is 124

Yes 16

An 971
alternative 4
is 124
you 29
Elizabeth 5
this 6
day 27
you 29
must 28
be 1204
a 6804

Elizabeth 5
not 85
but 82
smile 7
at 272
a 6804
conclusion 3
of 110
a 6804
beginning 3
but 82
Bennet 4
who 79
had 11
that 11
her 182
husband 10
the 193
affair 3
as 509
she 199
was 93
What 14
do 814
you 29
mean 36
Mr 5
Bennet 4
in 2719
this 6
way 27
You 29
me 1042

her 182
him 9
My 90
dear 15
her 182
husband 10
I 4330
have 11
two 14
small 14
to 805
request 6
First 8
that 11
you 29
will 40
allow 9
me 1042
the 193
free 93
use 18
of 110
my 90
understanding 4
on 86
the 193
present 20
occasion 7
and 51
of 110
my 90
room 22
I 4330
shall 12
be 1204
glad 30
to 805
have 11
the 193
to 805

soon 3
as 509

Not 85
yet 4
in 2719
spite 10
of 110
her 182
disappointment 3
in 2719
her 182
husband 10
did 23
Bennet 4
give 15
up 194
the 193
point 22
She 199
to 805
Elizabeth 5
and 51
and 51
her 182
by 57
turns 4
She 199
to 805
secure 6
Jane 9
in 2719
her 182
interest 6
but 82
Jane 9
with 34
all 162
possible 3
and 51
Elizabeth 5
with 34
real 47
and 51
with 34
playful 4
to 805
her 182
Though 12
her 182
manner 8
her 182
determination 3
never 3
did 23
Mr 5
was 93
in 2719
on 86
what 14
had 11
He 963
thought 11
too 50
well 24
of 110
to 805
comprehend 4
on 86
what 14
his 43
cousin 3
refuse 4
him 9
and 51
though 12
his 43
pride 6
was 93
hurt 12
he 963
in 2719
no 896
other 6
way 27
His 43
regard 7
for 485
her 182
was 93
and 51
the 193
of 110
her 182
her 182
reproach 8
his 43
feeling 4
any 17
regret 9
While 4

confusion 3
Charlotte 4
Lucas 3

She 199

this 6
morning 3
Mr 5

made 13
an 971
offer 10

she 199
will 40
not 85
have 11
him 9
Charlotte 4
had 11
time 45
to 805
answer 8
they 5
were 5
by 57
who 79
came 36
to 805
tell 16
the 193
same 5
news 71
and 51
no 896

on 86
the 193
subject 11
calling 3
on 86
Miss 71
Lucas 3
for 485
her 182
compassion 4
and 51
her 182
to 805
persuade 6
her 182
friend 14
to 805
with 34
the 193
of 110
all 162
her 182
Pray 9

my 90
dear 15
Miss 71
Lucas 3
she 199
in 2719
a 6804
tone 12
for 485
is 124
on 86
my 90
side 74
part 102
with 34
me 1042
I 4330
am 393
for 485
my 90
poor 11
reply 3
was 93
by 57
the 193
entrance 6
of 110
Jane 9
and 51
Elizabeth 5
Aye 4
there 21
she 199
comes 4
Bennet 4
as 509
as 509
may 49
be 1204
and 51
no 896
more 11
for 485
us 70
than 22
if 8
we 445
were 5
at 272
York 8
she 199
can 288
have 11
her 182
own 9
way 27
But 82
I 4330
tell 16
you 29
Miss 71
if 8
you 29

it 67
into 26
your 4
head 140
to 805

every 10
offer 10
of 110

this 6
way 27
you 29
will 40
never 3
get 13
a 6804
husband 10
at 272
all 162
and 51
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
who 79
is 124
to 805
maintain 8
you 29
when 6
your 4
father 12

dead 39
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
be 1204
able 3
to 805
keep 11
you 29
and 51

I 4330
warn 8
you 29
I 4330

done 3

you 29
this 6
day 27
I 4330
you 29
in 2719
the 193

never 3
speak 12

you 29
and 51
you 29
will 40
find 10
me 1042
as 509

as 509
my 90
word 26
I 4330
have 11
no 896
pleasure 5
in 2719
to 805
Not 85
that 11
I 4330
have 11
pleasure 5
in 2719
to 805
People 4
who 79

state 41
of 110
pride 6
Elizabeth 5
had 11
that 11
his 43
resentment 3
might 9
shorten 6
his 43

but 82
his 43
plan 61
did 23
not 85

the 193

well 24
over 597
To 805
Elizabeth 5
he 963
that 11
the 193
of 110
his 43

had 11
self 11
I 4330
found 18

might 9
be 1204
more 11

I 4330
bear 30
and 51
that 11

arise 3
unpleasant 4

She 199

His 43

was 93
a 6804
double 14
advantage 6
she 199
felt 5
all 162
the 193
compliment 6
it 67
to 805
and 51
it 67
was 93
most 3
acceptable 3
as 509
an 971
occasion 7
of 110

Soon 3

Elizabeth 5
saw 24
her 182

join 16
with 34
her 182
usual 3
in 2719
the 193
general 22
conversation 8
but 82
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
an 971
on 86
the 193
subject 11
off 101
her 182
attention 3
even 36
and 51
no 896
had 11
he 963

his 43
companion 10
leave 14
than 22
a 6804
glance 4
Jane 9

her 182
up 194
When 6
they 5

This 6

back 182
You 29
shall 12
hear 76
what 14
she 199
She 199
then 5
read 49
the 193
first 8

where 21
Mr 5
Hurst 3

a 6804
house 87
The 193

in 2719
these 4
words 5
I 4330
do 814
not 85
pretend 7
to 805
regret 9
anything 3
I 4330
shall 12
leave 14
in 2719
except 10
your 4
my 90
friend 14
but 82
we 445
will 40
hope 16
at 272
some 30
future 3
period 16
to 805
enjoy 9
of 110
that 11
we 445
have 11
and 51
in 2719
the 193
may 49
lessen 4
the 193
pain 42
of 110
separation 3
by 57
a 6804
frequent 9
and 51
most 3
correspondence 3
I 4330
depend 17
on 86
you 29
for 485
that 11
To 805
these 4
Elizabeth 5
with 34
all 162
the 193
of 110
distrust 7
and 51
though 12
the 193
of 110
removal 3
her 182
she 199
saw 24
nothing 5
in 2719
it 67
to 805
lament 10
it 67
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1204
that 11
absence 3
would 5
prevent 13
Mr 5
being 3
there 21
and 51
as 509
to 805
the 193
loss 3
of 110
she 199
was 93
that 11
Jane 9
must 28
cease 11
to 805
regard 7
it 67
in 2719
the 193
enjoyment 3
of 110
his 43
It 67
is 124
she 199
after 48
a 6804
short 62
pause 4
that 11
you 29
should 7
not 85
be 1204
able 3
to 805
see 70
your 4
friends 4
they 5
leave 14
the 193
country 12
But 82
may 49
we 445
not 85
hope 16
that 11
the 193
period 16
of 110
future 3
to 805
Miss 71
Bingley 3
forward 12
may 49
arrive 3
than 22
she 199
is 124
aware 3
and 51
that 11
the 193
you 29
have 11
as 509
friends 4
will 40
be 1204
with 34
yet 4
satisfaction 3
as 509
Mr 5
Bingley 3
will 40
not 85
be 1204
in 2719
London 5
by 57
them 9
that 11
none 32
of 110
the 193
party 3
will 40
return 14
into 26
this 6
winter 13
I 4330
will 40
read 49
it 67
to 805
you 29
When 6
my 90
brother 9
left 19
us 70
yesterday 3
he 963
that 11
the 193
business 13
him 9
to 805
London 5
might 9
be 1204
in 2719
three 12
or 333
four 26
but 82
as 509
we 445
are 12
certain 5
it 67
be 1204
so 797
and 51
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
that 11
when 6
Charles 5
to 805
town 27
he 963
will 40
be 1204
in 2719
no 896
hurry 3
to 805
leave 14
it 67
we 445
have 11
on 86
following 3
him 9
that 11
he 963
may 49
not 85
be 1204
to 805
spend 11
his 43
in 2719
a 6804
hotel 6
of 110
my 90
acquaintances 3
are 12
there 21
for 485
the 193
winter 13
I 4330
wish 13
that 11
I 4330
hear 76
that 11
you 29
my 90
friend 14
had 11
any 17
intention 5
of 110
making 4
one 19
of 110
the 193
crowd 5
but 82
of 110
that 11
I 4330
despair 6
I 4330
hope 16
your 4
Christmas 9
in 2719
may 49
abound 4
in 2719
the 193
that 11
season 12
and 51
that 11
your 4
will 40
be 1205
so 797
as 509
to 805
prevent 13
your 4
feeling 4
the 193
loss 3
of 110
the 193
three 12
of 110
whom 3
we 445
shall 12
deprive 3
you 29
It 67
is 124
by 57
this 6
Jane 9
that 11
he 963
comes 4
back 182
no 896
more 11
this 6
winter 13
It 67
is 124
that 11
Miss 71
Bingley 3
does 5
not 85
mean 36
that 11
he 963
should 7
Why 4
will 40
you 29
think 8
so 797
It 67
must 28
be 1205
his 43
own 9
doing 3
He 963
is 124
his 43
own 9
master 28
But 82
you 29
do 814
not 85
know 12
all 162
I 4330
will 40
read 49
you 29
the 193
passage 6
me 1042
I 4330
will 40
have 11
no 896
you 29
Mr 5
is 124
to 805
see 70
his 43
sister 10
and 51
to 805
confess 14
the 193
truth 7
we 445
are 12
less 19
eager 6
to 805
meet 9
her 182
I 4330
do 814
not 85
think 8
has 41
her 182
equal 17
for 485
and 51
and 51
the 193
affection 5
she 199
in 2719
and 51
is 124
into 26
something 3
still 13
more 11
the 193
hope 16
we 445
dare 15
entertain 12
of 110
her 182
being 3
hereafter 3
our 3
sister 10
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
I 4330
ever 33
to 805
you 29
my 90
on 86
this 6
subject 11
but 82
I 4330
will 40
not 85
leave 14
the 193
country 12
them 9
and 51
I 4330
trust 26
you 29
will 40
not 85
esteem 5
them 9
unreasonable 3
My 90
brother 9
her 182
he 963
will 40
have 11
frequent 9
now 10
of 110
her 182
on 86
the 193
most 3
intimate 5
footing 3
her 182
relations 5
all 162
wish 13
the 193
connection 3
as 509
as 509
his 43
own 9
and 51
a 6804
is 124
not 85
me 1042
I 4330
think 8
when 6
I 4330
call 57
Charles 5
most 3
of 110
any 17
heart 57
With 34
all 162
these 4
to 805
favour 6
an 971
attachment 3
and 51
nothing 5
to 805
prevent 13
it 67
am 393
I 4330
wrong 24
my 90
Jane 9
in 2719
the 193
hope 16
of 110
an 971
event 18
will 40
secure 6
the 193
of 110
so 797
What 14
do 814
you 29
think 8
of 110
this 6
sentence 4
my 90
dear 15
Jane 9
as 509
she 199
it 67
Is 124
it 67
not 85
clear 23
Does 5
it 67
not 85
declare 6
that 11
nor 102
me 1042
to 805
be 1205
her 182
sister 10
that 11
she 199
is 124
of 110
her 182
and 51
that 11

of 110
my 90
for 485
him 9
she 199
most 3
to 805
put 47
me 1042
on 86
my 90
guard 26
Can 288
there 21
be 1205
any 17
other 6
opinion 4
on 86
the 193
subject 11
Yes 16
there 21
can 288
for 485
mine 26
is 124
different 11
Will 40
you 29
hear 76
it 67
Most 3
You 29
shall 12
have 11
it 67
in 2719
a 6804
few 6
words 5
Miss 71
Bingley 3
sees 6
that 11
her 182
brother 9
is 124
in 2719
love 29
with 34
you 29
and 51
him 9
to 805
Miss 71
She 199
him 9
to 805
town 27
in 2719
hope 16
of 110
him 9
there 21
and 51
to 805
persuade 6
you 29
that 11
he 963
does 5
not 85
care 47
you 29
Jane 9
her 182
head 140
Jane 9
you 29
to 805
believe 6
me 1042
No 896
one 19
who 79
has 41
ever 33
you 29
together 3
can 288
doubt 15
his 43
affection 5
Miss 71
Bingley 3
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
She 199
is 124
not 85
a 6804
simpleton 3
she 199
have 11
half 23
as 509
love 29
in 2719
Mr 5
for 485
she 199
would 5
have 11
her 182
wedding 3
clothes 10
But 82
the 193
case 25
is 124
this 6
We 445
are 12
not 85
rich 19
or 333
grand 74
for 485
them 9
and 51
she 199
is 124
the 193
more 11
anxious 4
to 805
get 13
Miss 71
for 485
her 182
brother 9
the 193
notion 5
that 11
when 6
there 21
has 41
one 19
intermarriage 3
she 199
may 49
have 11
less 19
trouble 18
in 2719
a 6804
second 16
in 2719
there 21
is 124
some 30
and 51
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
it 67
would 5
succeed 4
if 8
Miss 71
de 2453
were 5
out 365
of 110
the 193
way 27
But 82
my 90
Jane 9
you 29
imagine 3
that 11
Miss 71
Bingley 3
you 29
her 182
brother 9
Miss 71
he 963
is 124
in 2719
the 193
degree 3
less 19
sensible 3
of 110
your 4
merit 13
than 22
when 6
he 963
leave 14
of 110
you 29
on 86
Tuesday 3
or 333
that 11
it 67
will 40
be 1205
in 2719
her 182
power 19
to 805
persuade 6
him 9
that 11
of 110
being 3
in 2719
love 29
with 34
you 29
he 963
is 124
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 182
friend 14
If 8
we 445
thought 11
of 110
Miss 71
Bingley 3
Jane 9
your 4
representation 4
of 110
all 162
this 6
might 9
make 17
me 1042
But 82
I 4330
know 12
the 193
foundation 3
is 124
unjust 5
is 124
of 110
and 51
all 162
that 11
I 4330
can 288
hope 16
in 2719
this 6
case 25
is 124
that 11
she 199
is 124
That 11
is 124
right 31
You 29
not 85
have 11
a 6804
more 11
idea 21
since 7
you 29
will 40
not 85
take 18
comfort 14
in 2719
mine 26
Believe 6
her 182
to 805
be 1205
by 57
all 162
You 29
have 11
now 10
done 3
your 4
by 57
her 182
and 51
must 28
fret 14
no 896
But 82
my 90
dear 15
sister 10
can 288
I 4330
be 1205
even 36
the 193
best 37
in 2719
a 6804
man 343
and 51
friends 4
are 12
all 162
him 9
to 805
You 29
must 28
decide 6
for 485
Elizabeth 5
and 51
if 8
mature 6
deliberation 3
you 29
find 10
that 11
the 193
of 110
his 43
two 14
is 124
more 11
than 22
equivalent 4
to 805
the 193
of 110
being 3
his 43
wife 6
I 4330
advise 9
you 29
by 57
all 162
to 805
refuse 4
him 9
How 27
can 288
you 29
talk 18
so 797
Jane 9
You 29
must 28
know 12
that 11
though 12
I 4330
should 7
be 1205
at 272
I 4330
not 85
hesitate 3
I 4330
did 23
not 85
think 8
you 29
would 5
and 51
that 11
being 3
the 193
case 25
I 4330
consider 13
your 4
situation 3
with 34
compassion 4
But 82
if 8
he 963
no 896
more 11
this 6
winter 13
my 90
choice 5
will 40
never 3
be 1205
A 6804
thousand 7
may 49
arise 3
in 2719
six 24
The 193
idea 21
of 110
his 43
no 896
more 11
Elizabeth 5
with 34
the 193
contempt 8
It 67
to 805
her 182
the 193
suggestion 3
of 110
and 51
she 199
not 85
for 485
a 6804
moment 15
suppose 4
that 11
or 333
influence 4
a 6804
young 9
man 343
so 797
independent 4
of 110
She 199
to 805
her 182
sister 10
as 509
as 509
possible 3
what 14
she 199
felt 5
on 86
the 193
subject 11
and 51
had 11
soon 3
the 193
pleasure 5
of 110
effect 15
temper 22
was 93
not 85
and 51
she 199
was 93
led 11
to 805
hope 16
though 12
the 193
of 110
affection 5
the 193
hope 16
that 11
Bingley 3
would 5
return 14
to 805
and 51
answer 8
every 10
wish 13
of 110
her 182
heart 57
They 5
that 11
Bennet 4
should 7
hear 76
of 110
the 193
departure 3
of 110
the 193
being 3
on 86
the 193
score 19
of 110
the 193
conduct 21
but 82
even 36
this 6
partial 6
communication 3
gave 4
her 182
a 6804
great 12
deal 13
of 110
concern 6
and 51
she 199
it 67
as 509
that 11
the 193
should 7
happen 9
to 805
go 500
just 24
as 509
they 5
were 5
all 162
so 797
intimate 5
together 3
After 48
it 67
at 272
some 30
length 14
she 199
had 11
the 193
consolation 3
that 11
Mr 5
Bingley 3
would 5
be 1205
soon 3
down 90
and 51
soon 3
at 272
and 51
the 193
conclusion 3
of 110
all 162
was 93
the 193
comfortable 3
declaration 3
that 11
though 12
he 963
had 11
to 805
a 6804
dinner 9
she 199
would 5
take 18
care 47
to 805
have 11
two 14
full 16
Chapter 3
The 193
were 5
to 805
dine 9
with 34
the 193
and 51
the 193
chief 14
of 110
the 193
day 27
was 93
Miss 71
Lucas 3
so 797
kind 31
as 509
to 805
listen 9
to 805
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5
an 971
of 110
her 182
It 67
keeps 4
him 9
in 2719
good 28
she 199
and 51
I 4330
am 393
more 11
to 805
you 29
than 22
I 4330
can 288
express 25
Charlotte 4
assured 4
her 182
friend 14
of 110
her 182
satisfaction 3
in 2719
being 3
useful 4
and 51
that 11
it 67
her 182
for 485
the 193
little 6
sacrifice 4
of 110
her 182
time 45
This 6
was 93
but 82
kindness 3
than 22
Elizabeth 5
had 11
any 17
conception 4
of 110
object 26
was 93
nothing 5
than 22
to 805
secure 6
her 182
any 17
return 14
of 110
Mr 5
by 57
them 9
was 93
Miss 71
scheme 7
and 51
were 5
so 797
that 11
when 6
they 5
at 272
night 61
she 199
would 5
have 11
felt 5
secure 6
of 110
success 13
if 8
he 963
had 11
not 85
to 805
leave 14
so 797
soon 3
But 82
here 31
she 199
did 23
injustice 3
to 805
the 193
fire 103
and 51
of 110
his 43
character 16
for 485
it 67
led 11
him 9
to 805
escape 10
out 365
of 110

morning 3
with 34
and 51
hasten 4
to 805

at 272
her 182
He 963
was 93
anxious 4
to 805
avoid 8
the 193
notice 8
of 110
his 43
a 6804
conviction 3
that 11
if 8
they 5
saw 24
him 9
depart 19
they 5
not 85
fail 12
to 805
conjecture 4
his 43
design 16
and 51
he 963
was 93
not 85
willing 4
to 805
have 11
the 193
attempt 5
till 14
success 13
might 9
be 1205
for 485

set 40
out 365
to 805

him 9
in 2719

But 82
little 6
had 11
she 199
dared 6
to 805

and 51
though 12
a 6804
solicitation 3
must 28
be 1205
for 485
the 193
present 20
the 193
lady 18
felt 5
no 896
inclination 3
to 805
trifle 7
with 34
his 43
The 193
with 34
he 963
was 93
by 57

ever 33
how 27
Mr 5
Bennet 4
was 93
to 805

Sir 22

it 67

his 43
opinion 4
that 11
Mr 5

be 1205
in 2719
possession 3
of 110

still 13

The 193

With 34

all 162
of 111
them 9
that 11
he 963
a 6804
quick 25
return 14
Bennet 4
to 805
understand 8
by 57
it 67
that 11
he 963
thought 11
of 111
his 43

one 19
of 111
her 182
and 51
Mary 13
might 9
have 11
on 86
to 805
accept 16
him 9
She 199
his 43
than 22
any 17
of 111
the 193
there 21
was 93
a 6804
in 2719
his 43
often 4
her 182
and 51
though 12
by 57
no 896
so 797
clever 6
as 509
she 199
thought 11
that 11
if 8
to 805
read 49
and 51
improve 6
by 57
an 971
example 4
as 509
hers 9
he 963
might 9
a 6804
agreeable 3
companion 10
But 82
on 86
the 193
following 3
morning 3
every 10
hope 16
of 111
this 6
kind 31
was 93
done 3
Miss 71
Lucas 3
soon 3
after 48
breakfast 5
and 51
in 2719
a 6804
private 9
conference 3
with 34
Elizabeth 5
related 3
the 193
event 18
of 111
the 193
day 27
The 193
of 111
Mr 5
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 182
friend 14
had 11
to 805
Elizabeth 5
within 3
the 193
last 7
day 27
or 333
two 14
but 82
that 11
Charlotte 4
encourage 6
him 9
as 509
far 91
as 509
she 199
encourage 6
him 9
and 51
her 182
was 93
so 797
great 12
as 509
to 805
at 272
first 8
the 193
of 111
and 51
she 199
not 85
help 23
out 365
to 805
Mr 5
My 90
dear 15
Charlotte 4
The 193
steady 3
countenance 4
Miss 71
Lucas 3
had 11
in 2719
her 182
story 13
gave 4
way 27
to 805
a 6804
confusion 3
here 31
on 86
so 797
direct 30
a 6804
reproach 8
though 12
as 509
it 67
was 93
no 896
more 11
than 22
she 199
she 199
soon 3
her 182
and 51
Why 4
should 7
you 29
be 1205
my 90
dear 15
Eliza 7
Do 814
you 29
think 8
it 67
that 11
Mr 5
should 7
be 1205
able 3
to 805
procure 8
any 17
good 28
opinion 4
he 963
was 93
not 85
so 797
as 509
to 805
succeed 4
with 34
you 29
But 82
Elizabeth 5
had 11
now 10
and 51
making 4
a 6804
strong 16
effort 7
for 485
it 67
was 93
able 3
to 805
assure 6
with 34
that 11
the 193
prospect 13
of 111
relationship 3
was 93
grateful 4
to 805
her 182
and 51
that 11
she 199
her 182
all 162
I 4330
see 70
what 14
you 29
are 12
feeling 4
Charlotte 4
You 29
must 28
be 1205
so 797
as 509
Mr 5
was 93
to 805
you 29
But 82
when 6
you 29
have 11
had 11
time 45
to 805
think 8
it 67
over 597
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 40
be 1205
with 34
what 14
I 4330
have 11
done 3
I 4330
am 393
not 85
romantic 13
you 29
know 12
I 4330
never 3
was 93
I 4330
ask 6
a 6804
comfortable 3
home 90
and 51
Mr 5
character 16
connection 3
and 51
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
I 4330
am 393
that 11
my 90
chance 20
of 111
with 34
him 9
is 124
as 509
fair 25
as 509
most 3
people 4
can 288
boast 12
on 86
the 193
marriage 6
state 41
Elizabeth 5
and 51
after 48
an 971
awkward 6
pause 4
they 5
to 805
the 193
rest 110
of 111
the 193
Charlotte 4
did 23
not 85
stay 7
and 51
Elizabeth 5
was 93
then 5
left 19
to 805
reflect 12
on 86
what 14
she 199
had 11
It 67
was 93
a 6804
long 50
time 45
she 199
at 272
all 162
to 805
the 193
idea 21
of 111
so 797
a 6804
match 25
The 193
of 111
Mr 5
making 4
two 14
of 111
marriage 6
within 3
three 12
was 93
nothing 5
in 2719
comparison 3
of 111
his 43
being 3
now 10
She 199
had 11
felt 5
that 11
opinion 4
of 111
was 93
not 85
like 22
her 182
own 9
but 82
she 199
had 11
not 85
it 67
to 805
be 1205
possible 3
that 11
when 6
into 26
action 4
she 199
would 5
have 11
every 10
better 7
feeling 4
to 805
advantage 6
Charlotte 4
the 193
wife 6
of 111
Mr 5
was 93
a 6804
most 3
picture 8
And 51
to 805
the 193
pang 5
of 111
a 6804
friend 14
and 51
sunk 4
in 2719
her 182
esteem 5
was 93
the 193
conviction 3
that 11
it 67
was 93
for 485
that 11
friend 14
to 805
be 1205
in 2719
the 193
lot 21
she 199
had 11
Chapter 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
sitting 3
with 34
her 182
mother 21
and 51
on 86
what 14
she 199

and 51
she 199
was 93

Sir 22

an 971
audience 3
not 85

Bennet 4
with 34
more 11
than 22
he 963
must 28
be 1205
and 51
Lydia 5
and 51
often 4
uncivil 3
Good 28
Lord 13
Sir 22
William 4
how 27
can 288
you 29

Do 814

to 805
put 47
a 6805
stop 36
to 805
the 193

by 57
making 4
a 6805
of 111

the 193

great 12
deal 13
while 4
Sir 22
William 4
but 82
no 896

he 963
left 19
them 9

her 182
found 18
a 6805
rapid 10
vent 41
In 2719
the 193
first 8
place 29
she 199
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
of 111
the 193
matter 7
she 199
was 93
sure 11
that 11
Mr 5
had 11
in 2719
she 199
that 11
they 5
would 5
never 3
be 1205
together 3
and 51
that 11
the 193

be 1205
broken 6
off 102
Two 14

Nor 102

A 6805

as 509
foolish 4
as 509
his 43

foolish 4
than 22
his 43
daughter 4
Jane 9

Her 182

The 193

To 805
assertion 3
of 111

credit 12
That 11

no 896
more 11
than 22

it 67
as 509
she 199
thought 11
he 963

It 67

a 6805
subject 11

were 5
the 193
case 25
though 12
her 182
opinion 4
of 111

be 1205
by 57
the 193
difference 3
her 182
situation 3

peace 21
A 6805
day 27
or 333
two 14
Jane 9
had 11
courage 6
to 805
speak 12
of 111
her 182
to 805
Elizabeth 5
but 82
at 272
last 7
on 86
leaving 3

together 3
after 48
a 6805
irritation 3
than 22
usual 3
and 51

saying 3
Oh 17
that 11
my 90
dear 15
mother 21
had 11
more 11
command 21
over 597
She 199
can 288
have 11
no 896
idea 21
of 111
the 193
pain 42
she 199
me 1042
by 57
her 182
on 86
him 9
But 82
I 4330
will 40
not 85
repine 3
It 67
last 7
long 50
He 963
will 40
be 1205
and 51
we 445
shall 12
all 162
be 1205
as 509
we 445
were 5
Elizabeth 5
at 272
her 182
sister 10
with 34
but 82
nothing 5
You 29
doubt 15
me 1042
Jane 9
you 29
have 11
no 896
reason 13
He 963
may 49
live 43
in 2719
my 90
as 509
the 193
most 3
man 343
of 111
my 90
acquaintance 5
but 82
that 11
is 124
all 162
I 4330
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
hope 16
or 333
fear 14
and 51
nothing 5
to 805
reproach 8
him 9
with 34
Thank 15
God 61
I 4330
have 11
not 85
that 11
pain 42
A 6805
little 6
time 45
I 4330
shall 12
try 12
to 805
get 13
the 193
better 7
With 34
a 6805
voice 8
she 199
soon 3
I 4330
have 11
this 6
comfort 14
that 11
it 67
has 41
not 85
more 11
than 22
an 971
error 3
of 111
fancy 5
on 86
my 90
side 74
and 51
that 11
it 67
has 41
done 3
no 896
harm 41
to 805
but 82
My 90
dear 15
Jane 9
Elizabeth 5
you 29
are 12
too 50
good 28
Your 4
and 51
are 12
angelic 6
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
what 14
to 805
say 7
to 805
you 29
I 4330
feel 11
as 509
if 8
I 4330
had 11
never 3
done 3
you 29
justice 3
or 333
you 29
as 509
you 29
deserve 4
Miss 71
Bennet 4
all 162
merit 13
and 51
back 182
the 193
praise 7
on 86
her 182
warm 23
affection 5
Nay 6
Elizabeth 5
this 6
is 124
not 85
fair 25
You 29
wish 13
to 805
think 8
all 162
the 193
world 12
and 51
are 12
hurt 12
if 8
I 4330
speak 12
ill 84
of 111
I 4330
want 13
to 805
think 8
you 29
perfect 24
and 51
you 29
set 40

Do 814
not 85
be 1205
of 111
my 90
into 26
any 17
excess 5
of 111
my 90
on 86
your 4
privilege 4
of 111
universal 10
good 28
will 40
You 29
need 29
not 85
There 21
are 12
few 6
people 4
whom 3
I 4330
love 29
and 51
still 13
of 111
whom 3
I 4330
think 8
well 24
The 193
more 11
I 4330
see 70
of 111
the 193
world 12
the 193
more 11
am 393
I 4330
with 34
it 67
and 51
every 10
day 27
my 90
belief 3
of 111
the 193
of 111
all 162
human 41
and 51
of 111
the 193
little 6
that 11
can 288
be 1205
on 86
the 193
appearance 3
of 111
merit 13
or 333
sense 8
I 4330
have 11
met 180
with 34
two 14
one 19

will 40
not 85
mention 5
the 193
other 6

marriage 6
It 67
is 124
In 2719
every 10
view 18
it 67
is 124
My 90
dear 15
do 814
not 85
give 15
way 27
to 805
as 509
these 4
They 5
will 40
ruin 10
your 4
You 29
do 814
not 85
make 17
allowance 3
for 485
difference 3
of 111
situation 3
and 51
temper 22
Consider 13
Mr 5
and 51
steady 3
prudent 5
character 16
Remember 4
that 11
she 199
is 124
one 19
of 111
a 6805
large 11
that 11
as 509
to 805
fortune 8
it 67
is 124
a 6805
most 3
match 25
and 51
be 1205
to 805
believe 6
for 485
sake 3
that 11
she 199
may 49
feel 11
something 3
like 22
regard 7
and 51
esteem 5
for 485
our 3
cousin 3
To 805
oblige 3
you 29
I 4330
would 5
try 12
to 805
believe 6
anything 3
but 82
no 896
one 19
be 1205
by 57
a 6805
belief 3
as 509
this 6
for 485
were 5
I 4330
that 11
Charlotte 4
had 11
any 17
regard 7
for 485
him 9
I 4330
should 7
think 8
worse 6
of 111
her 182
understanding 4
than 22
I 4330
now 10
do 814
of 111
her 182
heart 57
My 90
dear 15
Jane 9
Mr 5
is 124
a 6805
conceited 4
pompous 4
narrow 10
man 343
you 29
know 12
he 963
is 124
as 509
well 24
as 509
I 4330
do 814
and 51
you 29
must 28
feel 11
as 509
well 24
as 509
I 4330
do 814
that 11
the 193
woman 21
who 79
married 3
him 9
have 11
a 6805
proper 9
way 27
of 111
You 29
shall 12
not 85
defend 10
her 182
though 12
it 67
is 124
Charlotte 4
Lucas 3
You 29
shall 12
not 85
for 485
the 193
sake 3
of 111
one 19
individual 19
change 21
the 193
meaning 11
of 111
principle 4
and 51
nor 102
endeavour 3
to 805
persuade 6
or 333
me 1042
that 11
is 124
and 51
of 111
danger 7
for 485
I 4330
must 28
think 8
your 4
language 3
too 50
strong 16
in 2719
of 111
both 8
Jane 9
and 51
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 40
be 1205
of 111
it 67
by 57
them 9
together 3
But 82
of 111
this 6
You 29

something 3
You 29
two 14
I 4330
misunderstand 5
you 29
but 82
I 4330
entreat 8
you 29

blame 12
and 51
saying 3
your 4
opinion 4
of 111
him 9
is 124
sunk 4
We 445
must 28
not 85
be 1205
so 797
to 805
fancy 5
We 445
must 28
not 85
expect 20
a 6805
young 9
man 343
to 805
be 1205
so 797
and 51
circumspect 4
It 67
is 124
often 4
nothing 5
but 82
our 3
own 9
that 11
us 70
Women 5
fancy 5
more 11
than 22
it 67
does 5
And 51
men 140
take 18
care 47
that 11
they 5
should 7
If 8
it 67
is 124
done 3
they 5
be 1205
but 82
I 4330
have 11
no 896
idea 21
of 111
there 21
being 3
so 797
design 17
in 2719
the 193
world 12
as 509
some 30
imagine 3
I 4330
am 393
far 91
any 17
part 102
of 111
Mr 5
conduct 21
to 805
design 17
Elizabeth 5
but 82
to 805
do 814
wrong 24
or 333
to 805
make 17
there 21
may 49
be 1205
error 3
and 51
there 21
may 49
be 1205
want 13
of 111
attention 3
to 805
other 6
and 51
want 13
of 111
resolution 3
will 40
do 814
the 193
business 13
And 51
do 814
you 29
impute 3
it 67
to 805
of 111
Yes 16
to 805
the 193
last 7
But 82
if 8
I 4330
go 500
on 86
I 4330
shall 12
displease 3
you 29
by 57
saying 3
what 14
I 4330
think 8
of 111
you 29
esteem 5
Stop 36
me 1042
you 29
can 288
You 29
persist 8
then 5
in 2719
his 43
influence 4
him 9
Yes 16
in 2719
conjunction 3
with 34
his 43
friend 15
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
Why 4
should 7
they 5
try 12
to 805
influence 4
him 9
They 5
can 288
wish 13
his 43
and 51
if 8
he 963
is 124
to 805
me 1042
no 896
other 6
woman 21
can 288
secure 6
it 67
Your 4
first 8
position 6
is 124
false 12
They 5
may 49
wish 13
his 43
they 5
may 49
wish 13
his 43
increase 4
of 111
wealth 7
and 51
consequence 3
they 5
may 49
wish 13
him 9
to 805
a 6805
girl 14
who 79
has 41
all 162
the 193
of 111
money 17
great 12
and 51
pride 6
a 6805
doubt 15
they 5
do 814
wish 13
him 9
to 805
choose 5
Miss 71
Jane 9
but 82
this 6
may 49
be 1205
better 7
than 22
you 29
are 12
They 5
have 11
her 182
than 22
they 5
have 11
me 1042
no 896
wonder 17
if 8
they 5
love 29
her 182
better 7
But 82
may 49
be 1205
own 9
it 67
is 124
they 5
should 7
have 11
What 14
sister 10
would 5
think 8
at 272
to 805
do 814
it 67
there 21
were 5
something 3
If 8
they 5
him 9
to 805
me 1042
they 5
would 5
not 85
try 12
to 805
part 102
us 70
if 8
he 963
were 5
so 797
they 5
not 85
succeed 4
By 57
an 971
affection 5
you 29
make 17
and 51
wrong 24
and 51
me 1042
most 3
Do 814
not 85
distress 7
me 1042
by 57
the 193
idea 21
I 4330
am 393
not 85
of 111
or 333
at 272
least 3
it 67
is 124
light 42
it 67
is 124
nothing 5
in 2719
comparison 3
of 111
what 14
I 4330
should 7
feel 11
in 2719
ill 84
of 111
him 9
or 333
his 43
Let 50
me 1042
take 18
it 67
in 2719
the 193
best 37
light 42
in 2719
the 193
light 42
in 2719
it 67
may 49
be 1205
Elizabeth 5
not 85
oppose 3
a 6805
wish 13
and 51
this 6
time 45
Mr 5
name 17
was 93
ever 33
them 9
Bennet 4
still 13
to 805
wonder 17
and 51
repine 3
at 272
his 43
no 896
more 11
and 51
though 12
a 6805
day 27
in 2719
Elizabeth 5
did 23
not 85
account 14
for 485
it 67
there 21
was 93
little 6
chance 20
of 111
her 182
ever 33
it 67
with 34
less 19
Her 182
daughter 4
to 805
convince 3
her 182
of 111
what 14
she 199
did 23
not 85
believe 6
that 11
his 43
to 805
Jane 9
had 11
the 193
effect 15
of 111
a 6805
common 23
and 51
transient 4
when 6
he 963
saw 24
her 182
no 896
more 11
but 82
though 12
the 193
of 111
the 193
statement 5
was 93
at 272
the 193
time 45
she 199
had 11
the 193
same 5
story 13
to 805
repeat 12
every 10
day 27
best 37
comfort 14
was 93
that 11
Mr 5
Bingley 3
must 28
be 1205
down 90
in 2719
the 193
summer 13
Mr 5
Bennet 4
the 193
matter 7
So 797
he 963
one 19
day 27
your 4
sister 10
is 124
in 2719
love 29
I 4330
find 10
I 4330
congratulate 3
her 182
to 805
being 3
married 3
a 6805
girl 14
to 805
be 1205
a 6805
little 6
in 2719
love 29
now 10
and 51
then 5
It 67
is 124
something 3
to 805
think 8
of 111
and 51
it 67
her 182
a 6805
sort 14
of 111
distinction 3
her 182
companions 3
When 6
is 124
your 4
turn 46
to 805
come 36
You 29
will 40
bear 30
to 805
be 1205
long 50
by 57
Jane 9
Now 10
is 124
your 4
time 45
Here 31
are 12
in 2719
to 805
disappoint 8
all 162
the 193
young 9
in 2719
the 193
country 12
Let 50
be 1205
your 4
man 343
He 963
is 124
a 6805
pleasant 9
fellow 9
and 51
would 5
jilt 5
you 29
Thank 15
you 29
sir 22
but 82
a 6805
less 19
agreeable 3
man 343
would 5
satisfy 3
me 1042
We 445
must 28
not 85
all 162
expect 20
good 28
fortune 8
True 9
Mr 5
Bennet 4
but 82
it 67
is 124
a 6805
comfort 14
to 805
think 8
that 11
of 111
that 11
kind 31
may 49
befall 4
you 29
you 29
have 11
an 971
mother 21
who 79
will 40
make 17
the 193
most 3
of 111
it 67
Mr 5
was 93
of 111
material 17
service 13
in 2719
the 193
gloom 8
the 193
late 23
perverse 4
had 11
on 86
of 111
the 193
They 5
saw 24
him 9
often 4
and 51
to 805
his 43
other 6
was 93
now 10
that 11
of 111
general 22
unreserve 3
The 193
whole 26
of 111
what 14
Elizabeth 5
had 11
his 43
on 86
Mr 5
and 51
all 162
that 11
he 963
had 11
him 9
was 93
now 10
and 51
and 51
was 93
to 805
know 12
how 27
they 5
had 11
Mr 5
they 5
had 11
anything 3
of 111
the 193
matter 7
Miss 71
Bennet 4
was 93
the 193
creature 3
who 79
suppose 4
there 21
might 9
be 1205
any 17
in 2719
the 193
case 25
unknown 3
to 805
the 193
of 111
her 182
mild 14
and 51
steady 3
for 485
and 51
the 193
of 111
but 82
by 57
Mr 5
was 93
as 509
the 193
worst 6
of 111
men 140
Chapter 3
After 48
a 6805
week 20
in 2719
of 111
love 29
and 51
of 111
Mr 5
was 93
his 43
Charlotte 4
by 57
the 193
arrival 3
of 111
Saturday 3
The 193
pain 42
of 111
separation 3
might 9
be 1205
on 86
his 43
side 74
by 57
for 485
the 193
reception 6
of 111
his 43
bride 9
as 509
he 963
had 11
reason 13
to 805
hope 16
that 11
after 48
his 43
return 14
into 26
the 193
day 27
would 5
be 1205
that 11
was 93
to 805
make 17
him 9
the 193
of 111
men 140
He 963
leave 14
of 111
his 43
relations 5
at 272
with 34
as 509
as 509
his 43
fair 25
health 12
and 51
and 51
father 12
letter 20
of 111
thanks 4
On 86
the 193
following 3
Monday 3
Bennet 4
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 111
her 182
brother 9
and 51
his 43
wife 6
who 79
came 36
as 509
usual 3
to 805
spend 11
the 193
Christmas 9
at 272
Mr 5
was 93
a 6805
sensible 3
man 343
superior 5
to 805
his 43
sister 10
as 509
well 24
by 57
nature 5
as 509
education 9
The 193
would 5
have 11
had 11
in 2719
that 11
a 6805
man 343
who 79
by 57
trade 20
and 51
within 3
view 18
of 111
his 43
own 9
have 11
so 797
well 24
and 51
agreeable 3
who 79
was 93
several 3
than 22
Bennet 4
and 51
Phillips 3
was 93
an 971
intelligent 4
woman 21
and 51
a 6805
great 12
with 34
all 162
her 182
the 193
two 14
and 51
there 21
a 6805
particular 13
regard 7
They 5
had 11
with 34
her 182
in 2719
town 27
The 193
first 8
part 102
of 111
business 13
on 86
her 182
arrival 3
was 93
to 805
distribute 3
her 182
and 51
describe 6
the 193
When 6
this 6
was 93
done 3
she 199
had 11
a 6805
less 19
active 6
part 102
to 805
play 73
It 67
her 182
turn 46
to 805
listen 9
Bennet 4
had 11
to 805
relate 8
and 51
to 805
complain 13
of 111
They 5
had 11
all 162
ill 84
since 7
she 199
last 7
saw 24
her 182
sister 10
Two 14
of 111
her 182
had 11
the 193
point 22
of 111
marriage 6
and 51
after 48
all 162
there 21
was 93
nothing 5
in 2719
it 67
I 4330
do 814
not 85
blame 12
Jane 9
she 199
for 485
Jane 9
would 5
have 11
got 14
Mr 5
Bingley 3
if 8
she 199
But 82
Oh 17
sister 10
It 67
is 124
hard 70
to 805
think 8
that 11
she 199
might 9
have 11
Mr 5
wife 6
by 57
this 6
time 45
had 11
it 67
not 85
for 485
her 182
own 9
He 963
made 13
her 182
an 971
offer 10
in 2719
this 6
room 22
and 51
she 199
him 9
The 193
consequence 3
of 111
it 67
is 124
that 11
Lady 18
Lucas 3
will 40
have 11
a 6805
daughter 4
married 3
I 4330
have 11
and 51
that 11
the 193
estate 3
is 124
just 24
as 509
as 509
ever 33
The 193
are 12
artful 4
people 4
sister 10
They 5
are 12
all 162
for 485
what 14
they 5
can 288
get 13
I 4330
am 393
to 805
say 7
it 67
of 111
them 9
but 82
so 797
it 67
is 124
It 67
makes 4
me 1042
nervous 4
and 51
to 805
be 1205
so 797
in 2719
my 90
own 9
and 51
to 805
have 11
who 79
think 8
of 111
your 4
coming 3
just 24
at 272
this 6
time 45
is 124
the 193
of 111
and 51
I 4330
am 393
glad 30
to 805
hear 76
what 14
you 29
tell 16
us 70
of 111
long 50
to 805
whom 3
the 193
chief 14
of 111
this 6
news 71
had 11
given 3
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 111
Jane 9
and 51
correspondence 3
with 34
her 182
made 13
her 182
sister 10
a 6805
slight 11
answer 8
and 51
in 2719
compassion 4
to 805
her 182
the 193
conversation 8
When 6
with 34
Elizabeth 5
she 199
spoke 14
more 11
on 86
the 193
subject 11
It 67
to 805
have 11
a 6805
desirable 3
match 25
for 485
Jane 9
she 199
I 4330
am 393
it 67
off 102
But 82
these 4
happen 9
so 797
often 4
A 6805
young 9
man 343
as 509
you 29
describe 6
Mr 5
Bingley 3
so 797
in 2719
love 29
with 34
a 6805
pretty 3
girl 14
for 485
a 6805
few 6
and 51
when 6
accident 7
them 9
so 797
her 182
that 11
these 4
sort 14
of 111
are 12
frequent 9
An 971
consolation 3
in 2719
way 27
Elizabeth 5
but 82
it 67
will 40
not 85
do 814
for 485
us 70
We 445
do 814
not 85
suffer 11
by 57
accident 7
It 67
does 5
not 85
often 4
happen 9
that 11
the 193
of 111
friends 5
will 40
persuade 6
a 6805
young 9
man 343
of 111
independent 4
fortune 8
to 805
think 8
no 896
more 11
of 111
a 6805
girl 14
whom 3
he 963
was 93
in 2719
love 29
with 34
a 6805
few 6
But 82
that 11
expression 11
of 111
in 2719
is 124
so 797
so 797
doubtful 4
so 797
indefinite 4
that 11
it 67
me 1042
little 6
idea 21
It 67
is 124
as 509
often 4
to 805
arise 3
a 6805
half 23
acquaintance 5
as 509
to 805
a 6805
real 47
strong 16
attachment 3
Pray 9
how 27
was 93
Mr 5
love 30
I 4330
never 3
saw 24
a 6805
more 11
inclination 3
he 963
was 93
inattentive 4
to 805
other 6
people 4
and 51
by 57
her 182
Every 10
time 45
they 5
met 180
it 67
was 93
more 11
and 51
remarkable 3
At 272
his 43
own 9
ball 77
he 963
two 14
or 333
three 12
young 9
by 57
not 85
them 9
to 805
dance 7
and 51
I 4330
spoke 14
to 805
him 9
an 971
answer 8
there 21
be 1205
finer 3
Is 124
not 85
general 22
the 193
essence 3
of 111
love 30
Oh 17
yes 16
of 111
that 11
kind 31
of 111
love 30
I 4330
suppose 4
him 9
to 805
have 11
felt 5
Poor 11
Jane 9
I 4330
am 393
for 485
her 182
with 34
her 182
disposition 3
she 199
may 49
not 85
get 13
over 597
it 67
It 67
had 11
better 7
have 11
to 805
you 29
you 29
would 5
have 11
out 365
of 111
it 67
But 82
do 814
you 29
think 8
she 199
would 5
be 1205
to 805
go 500
back 182
with 34
us 70
Change 21
of 111
scene 5
might 9
be 1205
of 111
service 13
and 51
a 6805
little 6
relief 3
home 90
may 49
be 1205
as 509
useful 4
as 509
anything 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
with 34
this 6
proposal 3
and 51
felt 5
of 111
her 182
I 4330
hope 16
that 11
no 896
consideration 3
with 34
regard 7
to 805
this 6
young 9
man 343
will 40
influence 4
her 182
We 445
live 43
in 2719
so 797
different 11
a 6805
part 102
of 111
town 27
all 162
our 3
are 12
so 797
different 11
and 51
as 509
you 29
well 24
know 12
we 445
go 500
out 365
so 797
little 6
that 11
it 67
is 124
that 11
they 5
should 7
meet 9
at 272
all 162
he 963
comes 4
to 805
see 70
her 182
And 51
that 11
is 124
for 485
he 963
is 124
now 10
in 2719
the 193
of 111
his 43
friend 15
and 51
Mr 5
would 5
no 896
more 11
suffer 11
him 9
to 805
call 57
on 86
Jane 9
in 2719
a 6805
part 102
of 111
London 5
My 90
dear 15
aunt 6
how 27
you 29
think 8
of 111
it 67
Mr 5
may 49
have 11
of 111
a 6805
place 29
as 509
Street 15
but 82
he 963
would 5
think 8
a 6805
ablution 3
to 805
cleanse 6
him 9
were 5
he 963
to 805
enter 23
it 67
and 51
depend 17
it 67
Mr 5
Bingley 3
never 3
him 9
So 797
the 193
better 7
I 4330
hope 16
they 5
will 40
not 85
meet 9
at 272
all 162
But 82
does 5
not 85
Jane 9
correspond 11
with 34
his 43
sister 10
She 199
will 40
not 85
be 1205
able 3
to 805
help 23
calling 3
She 199
will 40
drop 22
the 193
acquaintance 5
But 82
in 2719
spite 10
of 111
the 193
in 2719
Elizabeth 5
to 805
place 29
this 6
point 22
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
still 13
more 11
one 19
of 111
being 3
Jane 9
she 199
felt 5
a 6805
on 86
the 193
subject 11
her 182
on 86
examination 3
that 11
she 199
did 23
not 85
consider 13
it 67
hopeless 4
It 67
was 93
possible 3
and 51
she 199
thought 11
it 67
probable 3
that 11
his 43
affection 5
might 9
be 1205
and 51
the 193
influence 4
of 111
his 43
friends 5
by 57
the 193
more 11
natural 18
influence 4
of 111
Miss 71

The 193

for 485
the 193
entertainment 3
of 111

that 11

her 182
after 48
her 182
what 14

on 86
You 29

too 50
sensible 3
a 6805
girl 14
to 805

Do 814

involve 6
or 333
endeavour 3
to 805
involve 6
him 9
in 2719
an 971
affection 5
the 193
want 13
of 111

would 5
make 17
so 797
I 4330
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
him 9
he 963
is 124
a 6805
most 3
young 9
man 343
and 51
if 8
he 963
had 11
the 193
fortune 8
he 963
to 805
have 11
I 4330
should 7
think 8
you 29
not 85
do 814
better 7
But 82
as 509
it 67

you 29
must 28
not 85
let 50
your 4

You 29

Your 4

would 5
depend 17
on 86
your 4
resolution 3
and 51
good 28
conduct 21
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
You 29
must 28
not 85
disappoint 8
your 4

My 90
dear 15

of 111
Mr 5

He 963

now 10
I 4330

your 4
pardon 10

try 12
At 272

Mr 5
no 896

But 82
he 963

the 193
most 3
agreeable 3
man 343
I 4330
ever 33
saw 24
and 51
if 8
he 963
to 805
me 1042
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
will 40
be 1205
better 7
that 11
he 963
should 7
not 85
I 4330
see 70
the 193
of 111
it 67
Oh 17

Mr 5
My 90
opinion 4
of 111
me 1042
does 5
me 1042
the 193
honour 4

I 4330
should 7
be 1205
miserable 3
to 805
forfeit 8
it 67
My 90
father 12
is 124
partial 6
to 805
Mr 5
In 2719
short 62
my 90
dear 15
aunt 6
I 4330
should 7
be 1205

be 1205
the 193
of 111
making 4
any 17
of 111
you 29
but 82
since 7

day 27
that 11
where 21
there 21

affection 5
young 9
people 4
are 12
by 57
immediate 4
want 13
of 111
fortune 8
into 26
with 34
other 6
how 27
can 288
I 4330
promise 4
to 805
be 1205

so 797
of 111
my 90
fellow 9
if 8
I 4330
am 393
or 333
how 27
am 393
I 4330
even 36
to 805
know 12
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1205
to 805
resist 17
All 162
that 11
I 4330
can 288
promise 4
you 29
is 124
not 85
to 805
be 1205
in 2719
a 6805
hurry 3
I 4330
will 40
not 85
be 1205
in 2719
a 6805
hurry 3
to 805
believe 6
his 43
first 8
object 26
When 6
I 4330
am 393
in 2719
with 34
him 9
I 4330
will 40
not 85
be 1205
In 2719

I 4330
will 40
do 814
my 90
best 37
it 67
will 40
be 1205
as 509
well 24
if 8
you 29
discourage 6
his 43
coming 3
here 31
so 797
often 4
At 272
least 3
you 29
should 7
not 85
remind 7
your 4
mother 21
of 111
him 9
As 509
I 4330
did 23
the 193
other 6
day 27
Elizabeth 5
with 34
a 6805
conscious 5
smile 7
true 9
it 67
will 40
be 1205
wise 17
in 2719
me 1042
to 805
refrain 5
that 11
But 82
do 814
not 85
imagine 3
that 11
he 963
is 124
here 31
so 797
often 4
It 67

on 86
your 4

She 199

at 272
last 7
appear 7
but 82
the 193
of 111
her 182
stay 7
and 51
yet 4
more 11
the 193
alteration 3
of 111
her 182
manner 8
would 5
allow 9
Jane 9
to 805
deceive 6
no 896
The 193
letter 20
she 199
on 86
this 6
occasion 7
to 805
her 182
sister 10
will 40
prove 21
what 14
she 199
felt 5
My 90
will 40
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
be 1205
of 111
in 2719
her 182
better 7
at 272
my 90
expense 3
when 6
I 4330
confess 14
to 805
have 11
in 2719
Miss 71
regard 7
for 485
me 1042
But 82
my 90
dear 15
sister 10
though 12
the 193
event 18
has 41
you 29
right 31
do 814
not 85
think 8
me 1042
if 8
I 4330
still 13
assert 11
that 11
what 14
her 182
was 93
my 90
confidence 3
was 93
as 509
natural 18
as 509
your 4
suspicion 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
at 272
all 162
comprehend 4
her 182
reason 13
for 485
to 805
be 1205
intimate 5
with 34
me 1042
but 82
if 8
the 193
same 5
were 5
to 805
happen 9
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
I 4330
should 7
be 1205
did 23
not 85
return 14
my 90
visit 14
till 14
yesterday 3
and 51
not 85
a 6805
note 16
not 85
a 6805
line 36
did 23
I 4330
receive 8
in 2719
the 193
When 6
she 199
did 23
come 36
it 67
was 93
that 11
she 199
had 11
no 896
pleasure 5
in 2719
it 67
she 199
made 13
a 6805
slight 11
formal 21
for 485
not 85
calling 3
not 85
a 6805
word 26
of 111
to 805
see 70
me 1042
and 51
was 93
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
so 797
a 6805
creature 3
that 11
when 6
she 199
I 4330
was 93
to 805
continue 3
the 193
acquaintance 5
no 896
I 4330
pity 4
though 12
I 4330
help 23
her 182
She 199
was 93
wrong 24
in 2719
me 1042
out 365
as 509
she 199
did 23
I 4330
can 288
say 7
that 11
every 10
advance 7
to 805
on 86
her 182
side 74
But 82
I 4330
pity 4
her 182
she 199
must 28
feel 11
that 11
she 199
has 41
wrong 24
and 51
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
that 11
for 485
her 182
brother 9
is 124
the 193
cause 14
of 111
it 67
I 4330
need 29
not 85
explain 5
and 51
though 12
we 445
know 12
this 6
to 805
be 1205
needless 4
yet 4
if 8
she 199
it 67
it 67
will 40
account 14
for 485
her 182
to 805
me 1042
and 51
so 797
dear 15
as 509
he 963
is 124
to 805
his 43
sister 10
she 199
must 28
feel 11
on 86
his 43
is 124
natural 18
and 51
I 4330
but 82
wonder 17
at 272
her 182
any 17
now 10
if 8
he 963
had 11
at 272
all 162
me 1042
we 445
must 28
have 11
met 180
long 50
ago 15
He 963
of 111
my 90
being 3
in 2719
town 27
I 4330
am 393
certain 5
something 3
she 199
and 51
yet 4
it 67
would 5
seem 10
by 57
her 182
manner 8
of 111
as 509
if 8
she 199
to 805
persuade 6
that 11
he 963
is 124
partial 6
to 805
Miss 71
I 4330
understand 8
it 67
If 8
I 4330
were 5
not 85
of 111
I 4330
should 7
be 1205
to 805
say 7
that 11
there 21
is 124
a 6805
strong 16
appearance 3
of 111
in 2719
all 162
this 6
But 82
I 4330
will 40
endeavour 3
to 805
banish 6
every 10
painful 6
thought 11
and 51
think 8
of 111
what 14
will 40
make 17
me 1042
your 4
affection 5
and 51
the 193
invariable 3
kindness 3
of 111
my 90
dear 15
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
Let 50
me 1042
hear 76
you 29
soon 3
Miss 71
Bingley 4
something 3
of 111
his 43
never 3
to 805
of 111
up 194
the 193
house 87
but 82
not 85
with 34
any 17
We 445
had 11
better 7
not 85
mention 5
it 67
I 4330
am 393
glad 30
that 11
you 29
have 11
pleasant 9
our 3
friends 5
at 272
Pray 9
go 500
to 805
see 70
them 9
with 34
Sir 22
William 4
and 51
Maria 12
I 4330
am 393
sure 11
you 29
will 40
be 1205
comfortable 3
there 21
Yours 3
etc 10
This 6
letter 20
gave 4
Elizabeth 5
some 30
pain 42
but 82
her 182
as 509
she 199
that 11
Jane 9
would 5
no 896
be 1205
by 57
the 193
sister 10
at 272
least 3
All 162
expectation 3
the 193
brother 9
was 93
now 10
over 597
She 199
would 5
not 85
even 36
wish 13
for 485
a 6805
renewal 3
of 111
his 43
His 43
character 16
sunk 4
on 86
every 10
review 8
of 111
it 67
and 51
as 509
a 6805
punishment 3
for 485
him 9
as 509
well 24
as 509
a 6805
possible 3
advantage 6
to 805
Jane 9
she 199
he 963
might 9
soon 3
Mr 5
sister 10
as 509
by 57
account 14
she 199
would 5
make 17
him 9
regret 9
what 14
he 963
had 11
Gardiner 3
this 6
time 45
Elizabeth 5
of 111
her 182
promise 4
that 11
gentleman 4
and 51
information 3
and 51
Elizabeth 5
had 11
to 805
send 10
as 509
might 9
give 15
to 805
her 182
aunt 6
than 22
to 805
His 43

over 597
he 963
was 93
the 193
admirer 3
of 111
some 30
one 19
Elizabeth 5
was 93
watchful 4
to 805
see 70
it 67
all 162
but 82
she 199
see 70
it 67
and 51
write 5
of 111
it 67
material 17
pain 42
Her 182
heart 57
had 11
but 82
and 51
her 182
was 93
with 34
that 11
she 199
would 5
have 11
his 43
choice 5
had 11
fortune 8
it 67
The 193
sudden 4
acquisition 3
of 111
ten 151
thousand 7
was 93
the 193
most 3
remarkable 3
charm 14
of 111
the 193
young 9
lady 18
to 805
whom 3
he 963
was 93
now 10
rendering 3
agreeable 3
but 82
Elizabeth 5
less 19
clear 23
in 2719
this 6
case 25
than 22
in 2719
did 23
not 85
quarrel 11
with 34
him 9
for 485
his 43
wish 13
of 111
Nothing 5
on 86
the 193
be 1205
more 11
natural 18
and 51
while 4
able 3
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
it 67
cost 32
him 9
a 6805
few 6
to 805
relinquish 6
her 182
she 199
was 93
to 805
allow 9
it 67
a 6805
wise 17
and 51
desirable 3
measure 8
for 485
both 8
and 51
wish 13
him 9
All 162
this 6
was 93
to 805
Gardiner 3
and 51
after 48
the 193
she 199
on 86
I 4330
am 393
now 10
my 90
dear 15
aunt 6
that 11
I 4330
have 11
never 3
in 2719
love 30
for 485
had 11
I 4330
that 11
pure 14
and 51
passion 9
I 4330
should 7
at 272
present 20
detest 8
his 43
name 17
and 51
wish 13
him 9
all 162
manner 8
of 111
evil 15
But 82
my 90
are 12
not 85
cordial 6
him 9
they 5
are 12
even 36
impartial 4
Miss 71
King 23
I 4330
find 10
out 365
that 11
I 4330
hate 14
her 182
at 272
all 162
or 333
that 11
I 4330
am 393
in 2719
the 193
least 3
unwilling 4
to 805
think 8
her 182
a 6805
good 28
sort 14
of 111
girl 14
There 21
can 288
be 1205
no 896
love 30
in 2719
all 162
this 6
My 90
has 41
and 51
though 12
I 4330
should 7
be 1205
a 6805
more 11
object 26
to 805
all 162
my 90
acquaintances 3
were 5
I 4330
in 2719

with 34
him 9
I 4330
say 7
that 11
I 4330
regret 9
my 90
comparative 4
may 49
be 1205
too 50
and 51
Lydia 5
take 18
his 43
defection 3
more 11
to 805

than 22
I 4330
do 814
They 5
are 12
young 9
in 2719
the 193
ways 4
of 111
the 193
world 12
and 51
not 85

open 21
to 805
the 193
conviction 3
that 11
handsome 6
young 9
men 140
must 28

something 3
to 805

Elizabeth 5

She 199
had 11
not 85
at 272

thought 11
of 111
going 3

faultless 4
a 6805
little 6
change 21
was 93
not 85
for 485
own 9
sake 3
The 193
journey 11
would 5
give 15
her 182
a 6805
peep 15
at 272
Jane 9
and 51
in 2719
short 62
as 509
the 193

The 193

leaving 3
her 182

miss 71

It 67
was 93

Not 85

strange 8
But 82
I 4330
suppose 4
you 29

no 896
Your 4

should 7
have 11
you 29

town 27
every 10

for 485
the 194
benefit 5
of 111

My 90
mother 21
would 5
have 11
had 11
no 896
objection 5
but 82
my 90
father 12
London 5
Has 41
your 4

left 19
you 29
We 446
never 3
had 11
any 17

No 896
governess 3
How 27
was 93
that 11
possible 3
Five 5
up 194
at 272
home 90
a 6806
governess 3
I 4330
never 3
of 111
a 6806
thing 15
Your 4
mother 21
must 28
have 11
a 6806
slave 14
to 805
your 4
education 9
Elizabeth 5
help 23
as 509
she 199
assured 4
her 182
that 11

not 85
the 194

Then 5
who 79
you 29
who 79
to 805
you 29
a 6806

you 29
must 28
have 11
with 34
some 30

believe 6
we 446
were 5

of 111

as 509

never 3
the 194
We 446
were 5
to 805
read 49

had 11
all 162
the 194
masters 4
that 11
were 5
who 79
to 805
be 1205
idle 10
might 9
Aye 4
no 896
doubt 15
but 82
that 11
is 124
what 14
a 6806
governess 3
will 40
prevent 13
and 51
if 8
I 4330
had 11
your 4
mother 21
I 4330
should 7
have 11
her 182
most 3
to 805
engage 6
one 19
I 4330
say 7
that 11
nothing 5
is 124
to 805
be 1205
done 3
in 2719
education 9
steady 3
and 51
regular 13
instruction 4
and 51
but 82
a 6806
governess 3
can 288
give 15
it 67
It 67
is 124
wonderful 4
how 27
I 4330
have 11
the 194
of 111
in 2719
that 11
way 27
I 4330
am 394
glad 30
to 805
get 13
a 6806
young 9
person 33
well 24
out 365
Four 26
of 111
are 12
most 3
through 4
my 90
and 51
it 67
was 93
but 82
the 194
other 6
day 27
that 11
I 4330
young 9
person 33
who 79
was 93
to 805
me 1042
and 51
the 194

her 182
did 23
I 4330
tell 16

The 194

sixteen 6
she 199
is 124
full 16
young 9
to 805
be 1205

But 82
I 4330
think 8
it 67
would 5
be 1205
hard 70
that 11
they 5
should 7
not 85
have 11
share 22
of 111
and 51
amusement 3
the 194
elder 7
may 49
not 85

the 194

inclination 3
to 805
The 194
last 7

as 509
good 28
a 6806
right 31
to 805
the 194

youth 7
as 509
the 194
first 8
And 51
to 805
be 1205
back 182
on 86
a 6806
motive 4
I 4330
think 8
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1205
to 805
promote 6
affection 5
or 333
of 111
mind 25
my 90
word 26

With 34

can 288
expect 20
me 1043
to 805

it 67
Lady 18
at 272
not 85
a 6806

Elizabeth 5
to 805
be 1205
the 194
first 8
creature 3
who 79
had 11
ever 33
dared 6
to 805

with 34
so 797
impertinence 3
You 29
be 1205
more 11

you 29
need 29
not 85

at 272

saw 24
that 11
her 182

an 971
reason 13
for 485
what 14
she 199
did 23

My 90

better 7

I 4330
an 971
introduction 3
but 82
I 4330
am 394
ill 84
to 805
recommend 8
to 805
Shall 12
we 446
ask 6
your 4
cousin 3
the 194
reason 13
of 111
this 6
Elizabeth 5
still 13
Colonel 5
Shall 12
we 446
ask 6
him 9
why 4
a 6806
man 343
of 111
sense 8
and 51
education 9
and 51
who 79
has 41
in 2719
the 194
world 12
is 124
ill 84
to 805
recommend 8
to 805
I 4330
can 288
answer 8
your 4
question 16
to 805
him 9
It 67
is 124
he 963
will 40
not 85
give 15
the 194
trouble 18
I 4330
have 11
not 85
the 194
talent 4
some 30
people 4
possess 16
of 111
with 34
I 4330
have 11
never 3
I 4330
catch 24
tone 12
of 111
conversation 8
or 333
appear 7
in 2719
as 509
I 4330
often 4
see 70
done 3
My 90
Elizabeth 5
do 814
not 85
move 10
over 597
this 6
instrument 16
in 2719
the 194
manner 8
I 4330
see 70
so 797
do 814
They 5
have 11
not 85
the 194
same 5
force 10
or 333
and 51
do 814
not 85
produce 7
the 194
same 5
expression 11
But 82
then 5
I 4330
have 11
it 67
to 805
be 1205
my 90
own 9
fault 20
I 4330
will 40
not 85
take 18
the 194
trouble 18
of 111
It 67
is 124
not 85
that 11
I 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
my 90
as 509
as 509
any 17
other 6
of 111
superior 5
execution 6
and 51
You 29
are 12
right 31
You 29
have 11
your 4
time 45
better 7
No 896

to 805
the 194
privilege 4
of 111
hearing 3
you 29
can 288
think 8
anything 3
We 446

Here 31
they 5
were 5
by 57
Lady 18

what 14
they 5
were 5
of 111

Lady 18
and 51
after 48
for 485
a 6806
few 6
minutes 3
to 805
Miss 71
Bennet 4
would 5
not 85
play 73
at 272
all 162
if 8
she 199
more 11
and 51
have 11
the 194
advantage 6
of 111
a 6806
London 5
master 28
She 199
has 41
a 6806
good 28
notion 5
of 111
fingering 3
though 12
her 182
taste 15
is 124
not 85
equal 17
to 805
Anne 19
would 5
have 11
a 6807
performer 3
had 11
her 182
health 12
her 182
to 805
learn 10
Elizabeth 5
at 272

see 70
how 27
he 963
to 805
his 43
praise 7
but 82
at 272
that 11
moment 15
nor 102
at 272
any 17
other 6

discern 9
any 17
symptom 5
of 111
love 30
and 51
the 194
whole 26
of 111
his 43
to 805
Miss 71
de 2456
she 199
this 6
comfort 14
for 485
Miss 71
Bingley 4
that 11
he 963
might 9
have 11
just 24
as 509
to 805
her 182
had 11
she 199
his 43
relation 8
Lady 18
her 182
on 86
performance 3
with 34
them 9
on 86
execution 6
and 51
taste 15
Elizabeth 5
them 9
with 34
all 162
the 194
of 111
and 51
at 272
the 194
request 6
of 111
the 194
at 272
the 194
instrument 16
till 14
her 182
carriage 5
was 93
to 805
take 18
them 9
all 162
home 90
Chapter 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
sitting 3
by 57
the 194
morning 3
and 51
writing 3
to 805
Jane 9
while 4
and 51
Maria 12
were 5
gone 4
on 86
business 13
into 26
the 194
village 6
when 6
she 199
was 93
by 57
a 6807
ring 30
at 272
the 194
door 41
the 194
certain 5
signal 18
of 111
a 6807
visitor 3
As 509
she 199
had 11
no 896
carriage 5
she 199
thought 11
it 67
not 85
to 805
be 1205
Lady 18
and 51
under 288
that 11
apprehension 3
was 93
her 182
half 23
letter 20
that 11
she 199
might 9
escape 10
all 162
when 6
the 194
door 41
and 51
to 805
her 182
great 12
surprise 4
Mr 5
and 51
Mr 5
the 194
room 22
He 963
too 50
on 86
finding 4
her 182
and 51
for 485
his 43
intrusion 3
by 57
her 182
know 12
that 11
he 963
had 11
all 162
the 194
were 5
to 805
be 1205
within 3
They 5
then 5
sat 92
down 90
and 51
when 6
her 182
after 48
were 5
made 13
in 2719
danger 7
of 111
into 26
total 17
silence 7
It 67
was 93
to 805
think 8
of 111
something 3
and 51
in 2719
this 6
when 6
she 199
had 11
him 9
last 7
in 2719
and 51
feeling 4
curious 4
to 805
know 12
what 14
he 963
would 5
say 7
on 86
the 194
subject 11
of 111
departure 3
she 199
How 27
you 29
all 162
last 7
November 3
Mr 5
It 67
must 28
have 11
a 6807
most 3
agreeable 3
surprise 4
to 805
Mr 5
Bingley 4
to 805
see 70
you 29
all 162
after 48
him 9
so 797
soon 3
for 485
if 8
I 4330
recollect 7
right 31
he 963
but 82
the 194
day 27
He 963
and 51
his 43
were 5
well 24
I 4330
hope 16
when 6
you 29
left 19
London 5
so 797
I 4330
thank 15
you 29
She 199
found 18
that 11
she 199
was 93
to 805
receive 8
no 896
other 6
answer 8
and 51
after 48
a 6807
short 62
pause 4
I 4330
think 8
I 4330
have 11
that 11
Mr 5
Bingley 4
has 41
not 85
idea 21
of 111
ever 33
to 805
I 4330
have 11
never 3
him 9
say 7
so 797
but 82
it 67
is 124
probable 3
that 11
he 963
may 49
spend 11
little 6
of 111
his 43
time 45
there 21
in 2719
the 194
future 3
He 963
has 41
friends 5
and 51
is 124
at 272
a 6807
time 45
of 111
life 44
when 6
friends 5
and 51
are 12
If 8
he 963
to 805
be 1205
but 82
little 6
at 272
it 67
would 5
be 1205
better 7
for 485
the 194
that 11
he 963
should 7
give 15
up 194
the 194
place 29
for 485
then 5
we 446
might 9
get 13
a 6807
there 21
But 82
Mr 5
Bingley 4
did 23
not 85
take 18
the 194
house 87
so 797
for 485
the 194
convenience 3
of 111
the 194
as 509
for 485
his 43
own 9
and 51
we 446
must 28
expect 20
him 9
to 805
keep 11
it 67
or 333
quit 15
it 67
on 86
the 194
same 5
principle 4
I 4330
should 7
not 85
be 1205
if 8
he 963
were 5
to 805
give 15
it 67
up 194
as 509
soon 3
as 509
any 17
purchase 7
Elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
She 199
was 93
of 111
of 111
his 43
friend 15
and 51
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
was 93
now 10
to 805
leave 14
the 194
trouble 18
of 111
finding 4
a 6807
subject 11
to 805
him 9
He 963
the 194
hint 13
and 51
soon 3
with 34
This 6
a 6807
comfortable 3
house 87
Lady 18
I 4330
believe 6
did 23
a 6807
great 12
deal 13
to 805
it 67
when 6
Mr 5
first 8
came 36
to 805
I 4330
believe 6
she 199
did 23
and 51
I 4330
am 394
sure 11
she 199
not 85
have 11
her 182
kindness 3
on 86
a 6807
more 11
grateful 4
object 26
Mr 5
to 805
be 1205
in 2719
his 43
choice 5
of 111
a 6807
wife 6
Yes 16
his 43
friends 5
may 49
well 24
rejoice 3
in 2719
his 43
met 181
with 34
one 19
of 111
the 194
few 6
sensible 3
women 6
who 79
would 5
have 11
him 9
or 333
have 11
made 13
him 9
if 8
they 5
had 11
My 90
friend 15
has 41
an 972
understanding 4
though 12
I 4330
am 394
not 85
certain 5
that 11
I 4330
consider 13
her 182
Mr 5
as 509
the 194
thing 15
she 199
ever 33
did 23
She 199
and 51
in 2719
a 6807
prudential 3
light 42
it 67
is 124
a 6807
good 28
match 25
for 485
her 182
It 67
must 28
be 1205
agreeable 3
for 485
her 182
to 805
be 1205
within 3
so 797
a 6807
distance 4
of 111
her 182
own 9
and 51
friends 5
An 972
distance 4
do 814
you 29
call 57
it 67
It 67
is 124
miles 4
And 51
what 14
is 124
miles 4
of 111
good 28
road 38
Little 6
more 11
than 22
half 23
a 6807
journey 11
Yes 16
I 4330
call 57
it 67
a 6807
distance 4
I 4330
should 7
never 3
have 11
the 194
distance 4
as 509
one 19
of 111
the 194
of 111
the 194
match 25
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
should 7
never 3
have 11
was 93
near 15
her 182
It 67
is 124
a 6807
proof 11
of 111
your 4
own 9
attachment 3
to 805
Anything 3
the 194
of 111
I 4330
suppose 4
would 5
appear 7
far 91
As 509
he 963
spoke 14
there 21
was 93
a 6807
sort 14
of 111
smile 7
Elizabeth 5
she 199
he 963
must 28
be 1205
her 182
to 805
be 1205
of 111
Jane 9
and 51
and 51
she 199
as 509
she 199
I 4330
do 814
not 85
mean 36
to 805
say 7
that 11
a 6807
woman 21
may 49
not 85
be 1205
too 50
near 15
her 182
The 194
far 91
and 51
the 194
near 15
must 28
be 1205
relative 4
and 51
depend 17
on 86
Where 21
there 21
is 124
fortune 8
to 805
make 17
the 194
of 111
distance 4
no 896
evil 15
But 82
that 11
is 124
not 85
the 194
case 25
here 31
Mr 5
and 51
have 11
a 6807
comfortable 3
income 5
but 82
not 85
a 6807
one 19
as 509
will 40
allow 9
of 111
frequent 9
and 51
I 4330
am 394
my 90
friend 15
would 5
not 85
call 57
near 15
her 182
under 288
less 19
than 22
half 23
the 194
present 20
distance 4
Mr 5
his 43
chair 20
a 6807
little 6
her 182
and 51
You 29
have 11
a 6807
right 31
to 805
strong 16
local 16
attachment 3
You 29
have 11
at 272
Elizabeth 5
The 194
gentleman 4
some 30
change 21
of 111
feeling 4
he 963
back 182
his 43
chair 20
a 6807
newspaper 9
the 194
table 27
and 51
over 597
it 67
in 2719
a 6807
voice 8
Are 12
you 29
with 34
Kent 9
A 6807
short 62
dialogue 3
on 86
the 194
subject 11
of 111
the 194
country 12
on 86
side 74
calm 10
and 51
concise 6

soon 3
put 47
an 972
end 95
to 805
by 57
the 194
entrance 6
of 111

Mr 5
related 3
the 194
mistake 5
had 11
his 43
on 86
Miss 71
Bennet 4
and 51
after 48
sitting 3
a 6807
few 6
minutes 3
saying 3
to 805
What 14
can 288
be 1205
the 194
meaning 11
of 111
this 6
Charlotte 4
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 963
was 93
gone 4
My 90
dear 15
Eliza 7
he 963
must 28
be 1205
in 2719
love 30
with 34
you 29
or 333
he 963
would 5
never 3
have 11
us 70
in 2719
this 6
familiar 12
way 27
But 82
when 6
Elizabeth 5
of 111
his 43
silence 7
it 67
did 23
not 85
seem 10
even 36
to 805
to 805
be 1205
the 194
case 25
and 51
after 48
they 5
at 272
last 7
suppose 4
his 43
visit 14
to 805
proceed 7
the 194
of 111
finding 4
anything 3
to 805
do 814
was 93
the 194
more 11
probable 3
the 194
time 45
of 111
year 19
All 162
field 15
sports 24
were 5
over 597
Within 3
doors 9
there 21
was 93
Lady 18
books 15
and 51
a 6807
billiard 3
table 27
but 82
be 1205
within 3
doors 9
and 51
in 2719
the 194
of 111
the 194
Parsonage 3
or 333
the 194
of 111
the 194
walk 25
to 805
it 67
or 333
of 111
the 194
people 4
who 79
in 2719
it 67
the 194
two 14
found 18
a 6807
temptation 3
this 6
period 16
of 111
every 10
day 27
They 5
at 272
times 10
of 111
the 194
morning 3
together 3
and 51
now 10
and 51
then 5
by 57
aunt 6
It 67
was 93
plain 27
to 805
them 9
all 162
that 11
Colonel 5
came 36
he 963
had 11
pleasure 5
in 2719
a 6807
persuasion 3
of 111
course 10
him 9
still 13
more 11
and 51
Elizabeth 5
was 93
by 57
her 182
own 9
satisfaction 3
in 2719
being 3
with 34
him 9
as 509
well 24
as 509
by 57
his 43
of 111
her 182
of 111
her 182
former 3
George 6
and 51
though 12
in 2719
them 9
she 199
saw 24
there 21
was 93
less 19
in 2719
Colonel 5
she 199
he 963
might 9
have 11
the 194
best 37
mind 25
But 82
why 4
Mr 5
came 36
so 797
often 4
to 805
the 194
Parsonage 3
it 67
was 93
more 11
difficult 5
to 805
understand 8
It 67
not 85
be 1205
for 485
as 509
he 963
sat 92
there 21
ten 151
minutes 3
together 3
opening 3
his 43
lips 8
and 51
when 6
he 963
did 23
speak 12
it 67
the 194
effect 15
of 111
than 22
of 111
choice 5
a 6807
sacrifice 4
to 805
not 85
a 6807
pleasure 5
to 805
He 963
not 85
what 14
to 805
make 17
of 111
him 9
Colonel 5
laughing 6
at 272
his 43
that 11
he 963
was 93
different 11
her 182
own 9
knowledge 4
of 111
him 9
not 85
have 11
her 182
and 51
as 509
she 199
would 5
to 805
have 11
this 6
change 21
the 194
effect 15
of 111
love 30
and 51
the 194
object 26
of 111
that 11
love 30
her 182
friend 15
Eliza 7
she 199
set 40
to 805
work 87
to 805
find 10
it 67
out 365
She 199
him 9
they 5
were 5
at 272
and 51
he 963
came 36
to 805
but 82
success 13
He 963
at 272
her 182
friend 15
a 6807
great 12
deal 13
but 82
the 194
expression 11
of 111
that 11
look 14
was 93
It 67
was 93
an 972
earnest 8
steadfast 4
gaze 21
but 82
she 199
often 4
there 21
were 5
in 2719
it 67
and 51
it 67
nothing 5
but 82
absence 3
of 111
mind 25
She 199
had 11
or 333
to 805
Elizabeth 5
the 194
of 111
his 43
being 3
partial 6
to 805
her 182
but 82
Elizabeth 5
at 272
the 194
idea 21
and 51
did 23
not 85
think 8
it 67
right 31
to 805
press 30
the 194
subject 11
the 194
danger 7
of 111
might 9
end 95
in 2719
disappointment 3
for 485
in 2719
her 182
opinion 4
it 67
not 85
of 111
a 6807
doubt 15
that 11
all 162
her 182
dislike 4
would 5
vanish 5
if 8
she 199
suppose 4
him 9
to 805
be 1205
in 2719
her 182
power 19
In 2719
her 182
kind 31
for 485
Elizabeth 5
she 199
her 182
Colonel 5
He 963
was 93
comparison 3
the 194
most 3
pleasant 9
man 343
he 963
her 182
and 51
his 43
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
was 93
most 3
but 82
to 805
counterbalance 4
these 4
Mr 5
had 11
patronage 3
in 2719
the 194
church 21
and 51
his 43
cousin 3
have 11
none 32
at 272
all 162
Chapter 3
More 11
than 22
did 23
Elizabeth 5
in 2719
her 182
ramble 7
within 3
the 194
park 18
meet 9
Mr 5
She 199
felt 5
all 162
the 194
of 111
the 194
mischance 3
that 11
should 7
bring 6
him 9
where 21
no 896
one 19
was 93
and 51
to 805
prevent 13
ever 33
happening 3
care 47
to 805
inform 21
him 9
at 272
first 8
that 11
it 67
was 93
a 6807
haunt 9
of 111
hers 9
How 27
it 67
occur 7
a 6807
second 16
time 45
was 93
odd 17
Yet 4
it 67
did 23
and 51
even 36
a 6807
third 4
It 67
like 22
ill 84
nature 5
or 333
a 6807
penance 3
for 485
on 86
these 4
it 67
was 93
not 85
a 6807
few 6
formal 21
and 51
an 972
awkward 6
pause 4
and 51
then 5
but 82
he 963
thought 11
it 67
to 805
turn 46
back 182
and 51
walk 25
with 34
her 182
He 963
never 3
a 6807
great 12
deal 13
nor 102
did 23
she 199
give 15
the 194
trouble 18
of 111
or 333
of 111
but 82
it 67
her 182
in 2719
the 194
course 10
of 111
third 4
that 11
he 963
was 93
some 30
odd 17
her 182
pleasure 5
in 2719
being 3
at 272
her 182
love 30
of 111
and 51
her 182
opinion 4
of 111
Mr 5
and 51
and 51
that 11
in 2719
of 111
and 51
her 182
not 85
understanding 4
the 194
house 87
he 963
to 805
expect 20
that 11
she 199
came 36
into 26
Kent 9
she 199
would 5
be 1205
there 21
too 50
His 43
words 5
to 805
it 67
he 963
have 11
Colonel 5
in 2719
his 43
She 199
if 8
he 963
meant 3
anything 3
he 963
must 28
mean 36
an 972
allusion 3
to 805
what 14
might 9
arise 3
in 2719
that 11
quarter 25
It 67
her 182
a 6807
little 6
and 51
she 199
was 93
glad 30
to 805
find 10
at 272
the 194
gate 25
in 2719
the 194
pales 8
opposite 4
the 194
Parsonage 3
She 199
was 93
one 19
day 27
as 509
she 199
in 2719
last 7
letter 20
and 51
dwelling 3
on 86
some 30
that 11
Jane 9
had 11
not 85
in 2719
when 6
of 111
being 3
by 57
Mr 5
she 199
saw 24
on 86
up 194
that 11
Colonel 5
was 93
meeting 6
her 182
the 194
letter 20
and 51
a 6807
smile 7
she 199
I 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
ever 33
this 6
way 27
I 4330
have 11
making 4
the 194
tour 23
of 111
the 194
park 18
he 963
as 509
I 4330
do 814
every 10
year 19
and 51
intend 6
to 805
close 22
it 67
with 34
a 6807
call 57
at 272
the 194
Parsonage 3
Are 12
you 29
going 3
No 896
I 4330
should 7
have 11
in 2719
a 6807
moment 15
And 51
she 199
did 23
turn 46
and 51
they 5
the 194
Parsonage 3
together 3
Do 814
you 29
leave 14
Kent 9
on 86
Saturday 3
she 199
Yes 16
if 8
does 5
not 85
put 47
it 67
off 102
But 82
I 4330
am 394
at 272
his 43
disposal 3
He 963
the 194
business 13
just 24
as 509
he 963
And 51
if 8
not 85
able 3
to 805
please 3
in 2719
the 194
arrangement 3
he 963
has 41
at 272
least 3
pleasure 5
in 2719
the 194
great 12
power 19
of 111
choice 5
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
who 79
more 11
to 805
enjoy 9
the 194
power 19
of 111
doing 3
what 14
he 963
than 22
Mr 5
He 963
to 805
have 11
his 43
own 9
way 27
well 24
Colonel 5
But 82
so 797
we 446
all 162
do 814
It 67
is 124
that 11
he 963
has 41
better 7
of 111
it 67
than 22
he 963
is 124
rich 19
and 51
are 12
poor 11
I 4330
speak 12
A 6807
son 70
you 29
know 12
must 28
be 1205
to 805
self 11
denial 3
and 51
In 2719
my 90
opinion 4
the 194
son 70
of 111
an 972
earl 20
can 288
know 12
little 6
of 111
Now 10
what 14
have 11
you 29
ever 33
of 111
self 11
denial 3
and 51
When 6
have 11
you 29
by 57
want 13
of 111
money 17
going 3
you 29
or 333
anything 3
you 29
had 11
a 6807
fancy 5
for 485
These 4
are 12
home 90
and 51
I 4330
say 7
that 11
I 4330
have 11
of 111
that 11
nature 5
But 82
in 2719
of 111
weight 21
I 4330
may 49
suffer 11
want 13
of 111
money 17
where 21
they 5
like 22
where 21
they 5
like 22
women 6
of 111
fortune 8
I 4330
think 8
they 5
often 4
do 814
Our 3
of 111
expense 3
make 17
us 70
too 50
dependent 4
and 51
there 21
are 12
not 85
in 2719
my 90
rank 19
of 111
life 44
who 79
can 288
afford 6
to 805
some 30
attention 3
to 805
money 17
Is 124
this 6
thought 11
Elizabeth 5
meant 3
for 485
me 1043
and 51
she 199
at 272
the 194
idea 21
but 82
in 2719
a 6807
tone 12
And 51
pray 9
what 14
is 124
the 194
usual 3
price 6
of 111
an 972
son 70
the 194
elder 7
brother 9
is 124
I 4330
suppose 4
you 29
would 5
not 85
ask 6
above 3
thousand 7
He 963
her 182
in 2719
the 194
same 5
style 4
and 51
the 194
subject 11
To 805
interrupt 11
a 6807
silence 7
might 9
make 17
him 9
fancy 5
her 182
with 34
what 14
had 11
she 199
soon 3
I 4330
imagine 3
your 4
cousin 3
you 29
down 90
with 34
him 9
for 485
the 194
sake 3
of 111
someone 3
at 272
his 43
disposal 3
I 4330
wonder 17
he 963
does 5
not 85
to 805
secure 6
a 6807
convenience 3
of 111
that 11
kind 31
But 82
his 43
sister 10
does 5
as 509
well 24
for 485
the 194
present 20
and 51
as 509
she 199
is 124
under 288
his 43
sole 32
care 47
he 963
may 49
do 814
what 14
he 963
with 34
her 182
No 896
Colonel 5
that 11
is 124
an 972
advantage 6
he 963
must 28
divide 10
with 34
me 1043
I 4330
am 394
with 34
him 9
in 2719
the 194
of 111
Miss 71
Are 12
you 29
And 51
pray 9
what 14
sort 14
of 111
guardians 3
do 814
you 29
make 17
Does 5
your 4
charge 8
give 15
you 29
trouble 18
Young 9
of 111
her 182
age 24
are 12
a 6807
little 6
difficult 5
to 805
manage 15
and 51
if 8
she 199
has 41
the 194
true 9
spirit 20
she 199
may 49
like 22
to 805
have 11
her 182
own 9
way 27
As 509
she 199
spoke 14
she 199
him 9
at 272
her 182
and 51
the 194
manner 8
in 2719
he 963
her 182
why 4
she 199
Miss 71
to 805
give 15
them 9
any 17
her 182
that 11
she 199
had 11
or 333
other 6
got 14
pretty 3
near 15
the 194
truth 7
She 199
You 29
need 29
not 85
be 1205
I 4330
never 3
any 17
harm 41
of 111
her 182
and 51
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
she 199
is 124
one 19
of 111
the 194
most 3
in 2719
the 194
world 12
She 199
is 124
a 6807
great 12
with 34
some 30
of 111
my 90
acquaintance 5
Hurst 3
and 51
Miss 71
Bingley 4
I 4330
think 8
I 4330
have 11
you 29
say 7
that 11
you 29
know 12
them 9
I 4330
know 12
them 9
a 6807
little 6
brother 9
is 124
a 6807
pleasant 9
man 343
he 963
is 124
a 6807
great 12
friend 15
of 111
Oh 17
yes 16
Elizabeth 5
Mr 5
is 124
kind 31
to 805
Mr 5
Bingley 4
and 51
a 6807
deal 13
of 111
care 47
of 111
him 9
Care 47
of 111
him 9
Yes 16
I 4330
believe 6
does 5
take 18
care 47
of 111
him 9
in 2719
where 21
he 963
most 3
care 47
something 3
that 11
he 963
me 1043
in 2719
our 3
journey 11
I 4330
have 11
reason 13
to 805
think 8
Bingley 4
indebted 3
to 805
him 9
But 82
I 4330
to 805
beg 59
his 43
pardon 10
for 485
I 4330
have 11
no 896
right 31
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
Bingley 4
was 93
the 194
person 33
meant 3
It 67
was 93
all 162
conjecture 4
What 14
is 124
it 67

And 51
what 14

He 963
did 23
not 85

arts 4
He 963
me 1043

Elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896

on 86
her 182
heart 57
swelling 3
with 34
After 48
her 182
a 6807
little 6
her 182
why 4
she 199
was 93
so 797
thoughtful 4
I 4330
am 394
of 111
what 14
you 29
have 11

she 199
Your 4
conduct 21
does 5
not 85
suit 21
my 90
Why 4
was 93
he 963
to 805
be 1205
the 194
judge 7
You 29
are 12
to 805
call 57
his 43
officious 4
I 4330
do 814
not 85
see 70
what 14
right 31
Mr 5
had 11
to 805
decide 6
on 86
the 194
of 111
his 43
inclination 3
or 333
why 4
his 43
own 9
he 963
was 93
to 805
determine 7
and 51
direct 30
in 2719
what 14
manner 8
his 43
friend 15
was 93
to 805
be 1205
But 82
she 199
as 509
we 446
know 12
none 32
of 111
the 194
it 67
is 124
not 85
fair 25
to 805
condemn 11
him 9
It 67
is 124
not 85
to 805
be 1205
that 11
there 21
was 93
affection 5
in 2719
the 194
case 25
That 11
is 124
not 85
an 972
unnatural 4
surmise 4
but 82
it 67
is 124
a 6807
of 111
the 194
honour 4
of 111
my 90
triumph 10
This 6
was 93
but 82
it 67
to 805
her 182
so 797
just 24
a 6807
picture 8
of 111
Mr 5
that 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
trust 26
with 34
an 972
answer 8
and 51

interruption 3
of 111
all 162

was 93
not 85

be 1205
that 11
any 17
other 6
people 4
be 1205
meant 3
than 22
with 34
whom 3
she 199
was 93
There 21
not 85
exist 15
in 2719
the 194
world 12
two 14
men 140
over 597
whom 3
Mr 5

boundless 4

That 11

If 8
his 43

mislead 4
him 9
he 963
was 93
the 194
cause 14
his 43
pride 6

caprice 3
were 5
the 194
cause 14
of 111
all 162
that 11
Jane 9
had 11

He 963

To 805

never 3

When 6
she 199
thought 11
of 111
her 182
mother 21
her 182
confidence 3
gave 4
way 27
a 6807

The 194

it 67
so 797
worse 6
the 194
evening 3
that 11
to 805
her 182

Chapter 3
When 6
they 5
were 5
gone 4
Elizabeth 5
as 509
if 8
to 805
exasperate 4
as 509
as 509
possible 3
Mr 5
for 485
her 182
employment 3
the 194
examination 3
of 111
all 162
the 194
Jane 9
had 11
to 805
her 182
since 7
her 182
being 3
in 2719
Kent 9
They 5
no 896
actual 11
complaint 3
nor 102
was 93
there 21
any 17
revival 8
of 111
past 71
or 333
any 17
communication 3
of 111
present 20
suffering 3
But 82
in 2719
all 162
and 51
in 2719
every 10
line 36
of 111
there 21
was 93
a 6807
want 13
of 111
that 11
had 11
to 805
her 182
style 4
and 51
proceeding 3
the 194
of 111
a 6807
mind 25
at 272
ease 10
with 34
and 51
had 11
ever 33
Elizabeth 5
every 10
sentence 4
the 194
idea 21
of 111
with 34
an 972
attention 3
it 67
had 11
on 86
the 194
first 8
perusal 3
Mr 5
shameful 4
boast 12
of 111
what 14
he 963
had 11
able 3
to 805
inflict 7
gave 4
her 182
a 6807
sense 8
of 111
her 182
It 67
was 93
some 30
consolation 3
to 805
think 8
that 11
his 43
visit 14
to 805
was 93
to 805
end 95
on 86
the 194
day 27
after 48
the 194
and 51
a 6807
still 13
that 11
in 2719
less 19
than 22
a 6807
fortnight 4
she 199
should 7
be 1205
with 34
Jane 9
and 51
to 805
contribute 3
to 805
the 194
of 111
her 182
by 57
all 162
that 11
affection 5
do 814
She 199
not 85
think 8
of 111
leaving 3
Kent 9
that 11
his 43
cousin 3
was 93
to 805
go 500
with 34
him 9
but 82
Colonel 5
had 11
made 13
it 67
clear 23
that 11
he 963
had 11
no 896
at 272
all 162
and 51
agreeable 3
as 509
he 963
was 93
she 199
did 23
not 85
mean 36
to 805
be 1205
him 9
While 4
this 6
point 22
she 199
was 93
by 57
the 194
sound 29
of 111
the 194
door 41
bell 66
and 51
her 182
were 5
a 6807
little 6
by 57
the 194
idea 21
of 111
being 3
Colonel 5
who 79
had 11
late 23
in 2719
the 194
evening 3
and 51
might 9
now 10
come 36
to 805
inquire 6
after 48
her 182
But 82
this 6
idea 21
was 93
soon 3
and 51
her 182
were 5
when 6
to 805
her 182
utter 10
she 199
saw 24
Mr 5
walk 25
into 26
the 194
room 22
In 2719
an 972
manner 8
he 963
an 972
after 48
her 182
health 12
his 43
visit 14
to 805
a 6807
wish 13
of 111
hearing 3
that 11
she 199
were 5
better 7
She 199
him 9
with 34
cold 9
He 963
sat 92
down 90
for 485
a 6807
few 6
and 51
then 5
up 194
the 194
room 22
Elizabeth 5
was 93
but 82
not 85
a 6807
word 26
After 48
a 6807
silence 7
of 111
several 3
minutes 3
he 963
came 36
her 182
in 2719
an 972
manner 8
and 51
In 2719
vain 8
I 4330
have 11
It 67
will 40
not 85
do 814
My 90
will 40
not 85
be 1205
You 29
must 28
allow 9
me 1043
to 805
tell 16
you 29
how 27
I 4330
admire 6
and 51
love 30
you 29
was 93
expression 11
She 199
and 51
was 93
silent 6
This 6
he 963
encouragement 3
and 51
the 194
avowal 3
of 111
all 162
that 11
he 963
felt 5
and 51
had 11
long 50
felt 5
for 485
her 182
He 963
spoke 14
well 24
but 82
there 21
were 5
of 111
the 194
heart 57
to 805
be 1205
and 51
he 963
was 93
not 85
more 11
on 86
the 194
subject 11
of 111
than 22
of 111
pride 6
His 43
sense 8
of 111
her 182
of 111
being 3
a 6807
of 111
the 194
had 11
to 805
inclination 3
were 5
on 86
with 34
a 6807
due 21
to 805
the 194
consequence 3
he 963
was 93
but 82
was 93
to 805
recommend 8
his 43
suit 21
In 2719
spite 10
of 111
her 182
dislike 4
she 199
not 85
be 1205
to 805
the 194
compliment 6
of 111
a 6807
affection 5
and 51
though 12
her 182
did 23
not 85
for 485
an 972
instant 11
she 199
was 93
at 272
first 8
for 485
the 194
pain 42
he 963
was 93
to 805
receive 8
till 14
to 805
resentment 3
by 57
his 43
language 3
she 199
all 162
compassion 4
in 2719
anger 5
She 199
to 805
compose 7
to 805
answer 8
him 9
with 34
when 6
he 963
should 7
have 11
done 3
He 963
with 34
to 805
her 182
the 194
strength 10
of 111
that 11
attachment 3
in 2719
spite 10
of 111
all 162
his 43
he 963
had 11
found 18
to 805
conquer 8
and 51
with 34
his 43
hope 16
that 11
it 67
would 5
now 10
be 1205
by 57
her 182
acceptance 3
of 111
his 43
hand 137
As 509
he 963
this 6
she 199
see 70
that 11
he 963
had 11
no 896
doubt 15
of 111
a 6807
answer 8
He 963
spoke 14
of 111
apprehension 3
and 51
but 82
his 43
countenance 4
real 47
a 6807
circumstance 4
exasperate 4
and 51
when 6
he 963
the 194
colour 3
rose 37
into 26
her 182
and 51
she 199
In 2719
as 509
this 6
it 67
is 124
I 4330
believe 6
the 194
mode 57
to 805
express 25
a 6807
sense 8
of 111
obligation 3
for 485
the 194
they 5
may 49
be 1205
It 67
is 124
natural 18
that 11
obligation 3
should 7
be 1205
felt 5
and 51
if 8
I 4330
feel 11
I 4330
would 5
now 10
thank 15
you 29
But 82
I 4330
I 4330
have 11
never 3
your 4
good 28
opinion 4
and 51
you 29
have 11
it 67
most 3
I 4330
am 394
to 805
have 11
pain 42
to 805
It 67
has 41
most 3
done 3
and 51
I 4330
hope 16
will 40
be 1205
of 111
short 62
The 194
you 29
tell 16
me 1043
have 11
long 50
the 194
acknowledgment 3
of 111
your 4
regard 7
can 288
have 11
little 6
in 2719
it 67
after 48
this 6
explanation 3
Mr 5
who 79
was 93
leaning 3
the 194
mantelpiece 3
with 34
his 43
eyes 8
on 86
her 182
face 19
to 805
catch 24
her 182
words 5
with 34
no 896
less 19
resentment 3
than 22
surprise 4
His 43
complexion 5
pale 41
with 34
anger 5
and 51
the 194
disturbance 3
of 111
his 43
mind 25
was 93
in 2719
every 10
feature 5
He 963
was 93
for 485
the 194
appearance 3
of 111
and 51
would 5
not 85
open 21
his 43
lips 8
till 14
he 963
to 805
have 11
it 67
The 194
pause 4
was 93
to 805
dreadful 4
At 272
length 14
with 34
a 6807
voice 8
of 111
he 963
And 51
this 6
is 124
all 162
the 194
reply 3
I 4330
am 394
to 805
have 11
the 194
honour 4
of 111
I 4330
might 9
wish 13
to 805
be 1205
why 4
with 34
so 797
little 6
endeavour 4
at 272
I 4330
am 394
But 82
it 67
is 124
of 111
small 14
I 4330
might 9
as 509
well 24
inquire 6
she 199

her 182
while 4
she 199
I 4330
have 11
every 10
reason 13

the 194

with 34
an 972

in 2719
my 90

I 4330
have 11
kinder 7
than 22
Elizabeth 5
the 194
appearance 3
of 111
this 6
civil 15
reflection 3
but 82
meaning 11
did 23
not 85
escape 10
nor 102
was 93
it 67
to 805

her 182
But 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
this 6
affair 3
she 199
on 86
my 90

Long 50
it 67
had 11
place 29
my 90

Mr 5
On 86
this 6
subject 11
what 14
can 288
you 29
have 11
to 805
say 7
In 2719
what 14
act 69
of 111
friendship 3
can 288
you 29
here 31
defend 10
or 333
under 288
what 14
misrepresentation 3
can 288
you 29
here 31
impose 6
You 29
take 18
an 972
eager 6
interest 6
in 2719
that 11
in 2719
a 6807
less 19
tranquil 14
tone 12
and 51
with 34
a 6807
colour 3
Who 79
that 11
what 14
his 43

can 288
help 23
feeling 4
an 972

in 2719
him 9
His 43

And 51

You 29

state 41
of 111
comparative 4
You 29

the 194
you 29
must 28
know 12
to 805
have 11
for 485
him 9
You 29
have 11
the 194
best 37
of 111
his 43
life 44
of 111
that 11
was 93
no 896
less 19
his 43
due 21
than 22
his 43
desert 12
You 29
have 11
done 3
all 162
this 6
and 51
yet 4
you 29
can 288
treat 15
the 194
mention 5
of 111
his 43
misfortune 3
with 34
contempt 8
and 51
ridicule 4
And 51
this 6
as 509
he 963
with 34
quick 25
steps 7
the 194
room 22
is 124
your 4
opinion 4
of 111
me 1043
This 6
is 124
the 194
estimation 3

you 29
hold 22
me 1043
I 4330
thank 15
you 29
for 485
it 67
so 797
My 90
to 805
this 6
calculation 3
are 12
heavy 7
But 82
he 963
in 2719
his 43
walk 25
and 51
turning 3
her 182
these 4
might 9
have 11
had 11
not 85
your 4
pride 6
hurt 12
by 57
my 90
honest 6
confession 6
of 111
the 194
that 11

long 50
my 90
any 17
serious 4
design 17
These 4
bitter 15
might 9
have 11
had 11
I 4330
with 34
policy 7
my 90
and 51
you 29
into 26
the 194
belief 3
of 111
my 90
being 3
by 57
inclination 3
by 57
reason 13
by 57
reflection 3
by 57
But 82
disguise 4
of 111
every 10
sort 14
is 124
my 90
Nor 102
am 394
I 4330
of 111
the 194
I 4330
related 3
They 5
were 5
natural 18
and 51
just 24
you 29
expect 20
me 1043
to 805
rejoice 3
in 2719
the 194
of 111
your 4

congratulate 3
on 86
the 194
hope 16
of 111

so 797
my 90
own 9
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
more 11
every 10
moment 15
yet 4
she 199
to 805
the 194
to 805
speak 12
with 34
when 6
she 199
You 29
are 12
Mr 5
if 8
you 29

have 11
felt 5
in 2719
you 29
had 11
you 29
in 2719
a 6807
more 11
manner 8
She 199
saw 24
him 9
start 13
at 272
this 6
but 82
he 963
nothing 5
and 51
she 199
You 29
not 85
have 11
made 13
the 194
offer 10
of 111
your 4
hand 137
in 2719
any 17
possible 3
way 27
that 11
would 5
have 11
me 1043
to 805
accept 16
it 67
his 43
was 93
obvious 4
and 51
he 963
at 272
her 182
with 34
an 972
expression 11
of 111
and 51
She 199
on 86
the 194
beginning 3
the 194
first 8
moment 15
I 4330
may 49
say 7
of 111
my 90
acquaintance 5
with 34
you 29
your 4
me 1043
with 34
the 194
belief 3
of 111
your 4
your 4
conceit 7
and 51
your 4
selfish 4
disdain 7
of 111
the 194
of 111
were 5
as 509
to 805
form 68
the 194
of 111

so 797
a 6807
dislike 4
and 51
I 4330
had 11
not 85
you 29
a 6807
month 6
I 4330
felt 5
that 11
you 29
were 5
the 194
last 7
man 343
in 2719
the 194
world 12
whom 3
I 4330
ever 33
be 1205
on 86
to 805
You 29

madam 5
I 4330
comprehend 4
your 4
and 51

now 10
to 805

of 111
what 14
my 90
own 9
have 11
Forgive 8
me 1043
for 485
up 194
so 797
of 111
your 4
time 45
and 51
accept 16
my 90
best 37
for 485
your 4
health 12
and 51
And 51
with 34
these 4
words 5
he 963
left 19
the 194
room 22
and 51
Elizabeth 5

the 194
moment 15
open 21
the 194
front 29
door 41
and 51
quit 15
the 194
house 87
The 194
tumult 5
of 111
her 182
mind 25
was 93
now 10
great 12
She 199
not 85
how 27
to 805

and 51
actual 11
weakness 3
sat 92
down 90
and 51
for 485
half 23
an 972
hour 10
Her 182
as 509
she 199
on 86
what 14
had 11
was 93
by 57
every 10
review 8
of 111
it 67
That 11
she 199
should 7
receive 8
an 972
offer 10
of 111
marriage 6
Mr 5
That 11
he 963
should 7
have 11
in 2719
love 30
with 34
her 182
for 485
so 797
So 797
in 2719
love 30
as 509

his 43
her 182
sister 10
and 51
must 28
appear 7
at 272

with 34
equal 17
force 10
in 2719
his 43
own 9
case 25
was 93
It 67
was 93
to 805
have 11
so 797
strong 16
an 972
affection 5
But 82
his 43
pride 6
his 43
pride 6
his 43
shameless 4
avowal 3
of 111
what 14
he 963
had 11
done 3
with 34
respect 18
to 805
Jane 9

for 485
a 6807
moment 15
She 199
in 2719
till 14
the 194
sound 29
of 111
Lady 18
carriage 5
made 13
her 182
feel 11
how 27
unequal 3

the 194
immediate 4

the 194
of 111
Mr 5
and 51
to 805
have 11
off 102
the 194
companion 10
of 111
my 90
youth 7
the 194
of 111
my 90
father 12
a 6807
young 9
man 343
who 79
had 11
any 17
other 6
than 22
on 86
our 3
patronage 3
and 51
who 79
had 11
up 194
to 805
expect 20
exertion 3
would 5
be 1205
a 6807
to 805
the 194
separation 3

affection 5
be 1205
the 194
growth 3
of 111
a 6807
few 6
bear 30
no 896
comparison 3
But 82
the 194
of 111
that 11
blame 12
was 93
last 7
night 61
so 797
circumstance 4
I 4330
shall 12
hope 16
to 805
be 1205
in 2719
the 194
future 3
when 6
the 194
following 3
account 14
of 111
my 90
and 51
has 41
read 49
If 8
in 2719
the 194
explanation 3
of 111
them 9
is 124
due 21
to 805
I 4330
am 394
under 288
the 194
of 111
may 49
be 1205
offensive 6
to 805
yours 3
I 4330
can 288
say 7
that 11
I 4330
am 394
The 194
must 28
be 1205
and 51
further 8
would 5
be 1205
absurd 9
I 4330
had 11
not 85
long 50
in 2719
I 4330
saw 24
in 2719
common 23
with 34
that 11
Bingley 4
your 4
elder 7
sister 10
to 805
any 17
other 6
young 9
woman 21
in 2719
the 194
country 12
But 82
it 67
was 93
not 85
till 14
the 194
evening 3
of 111
the 194
dance 7
at 272
that 11
I 4330
had 11
any 17
apprehension 3
of 111
his 43
feeling 4
a 6807
serious 4
attachment 3
I 4330
had 11
often 4
him 9
in 2719
love 30
At 272
that 11
ball 77
while 4
I 4330
had 11
the 194
honour 4
of 111
with 34
you 29
I 4330
was 93
first 8
made 13
by 57
Sir 22
William 4
accidental 4
information 3
that 11
to 805
your 4
sister 10
had 11
given 3
rise 7
to 805
a 6807
general 22
expectation 3
of 111
marriage 6
He 963
spoke 14
of 111
it 67
as 509
a 6807
certain 5
event 18
of 111
the 194
time 45
be 1205
undecided 3
that 11
moment 15
I 4330
my 90
and 51
I 4330
then 5
perceive 3
that 11
his 43
for 485
Miss 71
Bennet 4
was 93
what 14
I 4330
had 11
ever 33
in 2719
him 9
Your 4
sister 10
I 4330
also 3
Her 182
look 14
and 51
were 5
open 21
cheerful 6
and 51
as 509
ever 33
but 82
any 17
symptom 5
of 111
peculiar 5
regard 7
and 51
I 4330
the 194
that 11
though 12
she 199
his 43
with 34
pleasure 5
she 199
did 23
not 85
invite 7
them 9
by 57
any 17
of 111
sentiment 18
If 8
you 29
have 11
not 85
here 31
I 4330
must 28
have 11
in 2719
error 3
Your 4
superior 5
knowledge 4
of 111
your 4
sister 10
must 28
make 17
the 194
latter 3
probable 3
If 8
it 67
be 1205
so 797
if 8
I 4330
have 11
by 57
error 3
to 805
inflict 7
pain 42
on 86
her 182
your 4
resentment 3
has 41
not 85
unreasonable 3
But 82
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
scruple 4
to 805
assert 11
that 11
the 194
of 111
your 4
countenance 4
and 51
air 129
was 93
as 509
might 9
have 11
given 3
the 194
most 3
acute 8
observer 3
a 6807
conviction 3
that 11
her 182
temper 22
her 182
heart 57
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1205
That 11
I 4330
was 93
of 111
her 182
is 124
certain 5
but 82
I 4330
will 40
venture 8
to 805
say 7
that 11
my 90
investigation 3
and 51
are 12
not 85
by 57
my 90
or 333
I 4330
did 23
not 85
believe 6
her 182
to 805
be 1205
I 4330
it 67
I 4330
it 67
on 86
impartial 4
conviction 3
as 509
as 509
I 4330
it 67
in 2719
reason 13
My 90
to 805
the 194
marriage 6
were 5
not 85
I 4330
last 7
night 61
to 805
have 11
the 194
force 10
of 111
passion 9
to 805
put 47
aside 3
in 2719
my 90
own 9
case 25
the 194
want 13
of 111
connection 3
not 85
be 1205
so 797
great 12
an 972
evil 15
to 805
my 90
friend 15
as 509
to 805
me 1043
But 82
there 21
were 5
other 6
of 111
though 12
still 13
and 51
to 805
an 972
equal 17
degree 3
in 2719
both 8
I 4330
had 11
to 805
forget 8
they 5
were 5
not 85
me 1043
These 4
must 28
be 1205
though 12
The 194
situation 3
of 111
your 4
though 12
was 93
nothing 5
in 2719
comparison 3
to 805
that 11
total 17
want 13
of 111
so 797
so 797
by 57
by 57
your 4
three 12
and 51
even 36
by 57
your 4
father 12
Pardon 10
me 1043
It 67
pains 4
me 1043
to 805
offend 7
you 29
But 82
your 4
concern 6
for 485
the 194
of 111
your 4
relations 5
and 51
your 4
at 272
this 6
representation 4
of 111
them 9
let 50
it 67
give 15
you 29
consolation 3
to 805
consider 13
that 11
to 805
have 11
so 797
as 509
to 805
avoid 8
any 17
share 22
of 111
the 194
like 22
censure 7
is 124
praise 7
no 896
less 19
on 86
you 29
and 51
your 4
elder 7
sister 10
than 22
it 67
is 124
to 805
the 194
sense 8
and 51
disposition 3
of 111
both 8
I 4330
will 40
say 7
that 11
what 14
that 11
evening 3
my 90
opinion 4
of 111
all 162
was 93
and 51
every 10
inducement 3
have 11
led 11
me 1043
to 805
preserve 7
my 90
friend 15
what 14
I 4330
a 6807
most 3
connection 3
He 963
left 19
for 485
London 5
on 86
the 194
day 27
following 3
as 509
you 29
I 4330
am 394
certain 5
remember 4
with 34
the 194
design 17
of 111
soon 3
The 194
part 102
I 4330
is 124
now 10
to 805
be 1205
His 43
had 11
with 34
my 90
own 9
our 3
coincidence 3
of 111
feeling 4
was 93
soon 3
and 51
sensible 3
that 11
no 896
time 45
was 93
to 805
be 1205
in 2719
brother 9
we 446
on 86
him 9
in 2719
London 5
We 446
and 51
there 21
I 4330
in 2719
the 194
office 12
of 111
out 365
to 805
my 90
friend 15
the 194
certain 5
of 111
a 6807
choice 5
I 4330
and 51
them 9
But 82
this 6
remonstrance 3
might 9
have 11
or 333
his 43
determination 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
suppose 4
that 11
it 67
would 5
have 11
the 194
marriage 6
had 11
it 67
not 85
by 57
the 194
assurance 3
that 11
I 4330
not 85
in 2719
of 111
your 4
He 963
had 11
her 182
to 805
return 14
his 43
affection 5
with 34
sincere 4
if 8
not 85
with 34
equal 17
regard 7
But 82
Bingley 4
has 41
great 12
natural 18
with 34
a 6807
on 86
my 90
than 22
on 86
his 43
own 9
To 805
convince 3
him 9
that 11
he 963
had 11
was 93
no 896
difficult 5
point 22
To 805
persuade 6
him 9
into 26
when 6
that 11
conviction 3
had 11
given 3
was 93
the 194
work 87
of 111
a 6807
moment 15
I 4330
blame 12
for 485
done 3
There 21
is 124
but 82
one 19
part 102
of 111
my 90
conduct 21
in 2719
the 194
whole 26
affair 3
on 86
I 4330
do 814
not 85
reflect 12
with 34
satisfaction 3
it 67
is 124
that 11
I 4330
to 805
adopt 12
the 194
of 111
art 104
so 797
far 91
as 509
to 805
conceal 10
him 9
your 4
being 3
in 2719
town 27
I 4330
it 67
as 509
it 67
was 93
to 805
Miss 71
Bingley 4
but 82
her 182
brother 9
is 124
even 36
yet 4
of 111
it 67
That 11
they 5
might 9
have 11
met 181
ill 84
consequence 3
is 124
probable 3
but 82
his 43
regard 7
did 23
not 85
appear 7
to 805
me 1043
for 485
him 9
to 805
see 70
her 182
some 30
danger 7
this 6
this 6
disguise 4
was 93
me 1043
it 67
is 124
done 3
and 51
it 67
was 93
done 3
for 485
the 194
best 37
On 86
this 6
subject 11
I 4330
have 11
nothing 5
more 11
to 805
say 7
no 896
other 6
to 805
offer 10
If 8
I 4330
have 11
your 4
it 67
was 93
done 3
and 51
though 12
the 194
me 1043
may 49
to 805
you 29
appear 7
I 4330
have 11
not 85
yet 4
to 805
condemn 11
them 9
With 34
respect 18
to 805
that 11
other 6
more 11
accusation 3
of 111
Mr 5
I 4330
can 288
refute 6
it 67
by 57
you 29
the 194
whole 26
of 111
his 43
connection 3
with 34
my 90
Of 111
what 14
he 963
has 41
me 1043
I 4330
am 394
but 82
of 111
the 194
truth 7
of 111
what 14
I 4330
shall 12
relate 8
I 4330
can 288
summon 11
more 11
than 22
one 19
witness 5
of 111
Mr 5
is 124
the 194
son 70
of 111
a 6807
man 343
who 79
had 11
for 485
the 194
management 3
of 111
all 162
the 194
and 51
good 28
conduct 21
in 2719
the 194
discharge 4
of 111
his 43
trust 26
my 90
father 12
to 805
be 1205
of 111
service 13
to 805
him 9
and 51
on 86
George 6
who 79
was 93
his 43
godson 3
his 43
kindness 3
was 93
My 90
father 12
him 9
at 272
school 54
and 51
at 272
most 3
as 509
his 43
own 9
father 12
poor 11
the 194
extravagance 3
of 111
his 43
wife 6
would 5
have 11
to 805
give 15
him 9
a 6807
education 9
My 90
father 12
was 93
not 85
fond 17
of 111
this 6
young 9
were 5
he 963
had 11
also 3
the 194
opinion 4
of 111
him 9
and 51
the 194
church 21
would 5
be 1205
his 43
profession 14
intended 3
to 805
provide 13
for 485
him 9
in 2719
it 67
As 509
for 485
it 67
is 124
since 7
I 4330
first 8
to 805
think 8
of 111
him 9
in 2719
a 6807
different 11
manner 8
The 194
vicious 4
the 194
want 13
of 111
principle 4
he 963
was 93
careful 6
to 805
guard 26
the 194
knowledge 4
of 111
his 43
best 37
friend 15
not 85
escape 10
the 194
observation 4
of 111
a 6807
young 9
man 343
of 111
the 194
same 5
age 24
with 34
and 51
who 79
had 11
of 111
him 9
in 2719
Mr 5
not 85
have 11
Here 31
I 4330
shall 12
give 15
you 29
pain 42
to 805
what 14
degree 3
you 29
can 288
tell 16
But 82
may 49
be 1205
the 194
Mr 5
has 41
a 6807
suspicion 3
of 111
nature 5
shall 12
not 85
prevent 13
me 1043
his 43
real 47
character 17
it 67
even 36
motive 4
My 90
father 12
five 5
ago 15
and 51
his 43
attachment 3
to 805
Mr 5
was 93
to 805
the 194
last 7
so 797
steady 3
that 11
in 2719
his 43
will 40
he 963
it 67
to 805
me 1043
to 805
promote 6
his 43
advancement 3
in 2719
the 194
best 37
manner 8
that 11
his 43
profession 14
might 9
allow 9
and 51
if 8
he 963
that 11
a 6807
valuable 3
living 5
might 9
be 1205
his 43
as 509
soon 3
as 509
it 67
There 21
was 93
also 3
a 6807
of 111
one 19
thousand 7
His 43
own 9
father 12
did 23
not 85
long 50
survive 3
mine 26
and 51
within 3
half 23
a 6807
year 19
these 4
Mr 5
to 805
inform 21
me 1043
that 11
taking 4
he 963
I 4330
should 7
not 85
think 8
it 67
unreasonable 3
for 485
him 9
to 805
expect 20
some 30
more 11
immediate 4
advantage 6
in 2719
lieu 8
of 111
the 194
by 57
he 963
not 85
be 1205
He 963
had 11
some 30
intention 5
he 963
of 111
law 45
and 51
I 4330
must 28
be 1205
aware 3
that 11
the 194
interest 6
of 111
one 19
thousand 7
would 5
be 1205
a 6807
support 10
I 4330
than 22
him 9
to 805
be 1205
sincere 4
but 82
at 272
any 17
rate 9
was 93
to 805
accede 3
to 805
his 43
proposal 3
I 4330
that 11
Mr 5
not 85
to 805
be 1205
a 6807
the 194
business 13
was 93
soon 3
he 963
all 162
claim 12
to 805
in 2719
the 194
church 21
were 5
it 67
possible 3
that 11
he 963
ever 33
be 1205
in 2719
a 6807
situation 3
to 805
receive 8
it 67
and 51
in 2719
return 14
three 12
thousand 7
All 162
connection 3
us 70
now 10
I 4330
thought 11
too 50
ill 84
of 111
him 9
to 805
invite 7
him 9
to 805
or 333
admit 7
his 43
in 2719
town 27
In 2719
town 27
I 4330
believe 6
he 963
but 82
his 43
the 194
law 45
was 93
a 6807
mere 10
and 51
being 3
now 10
free 93
all 162
restraint 3
his 43
life 44
was 93
a 6807
life 44
of 111
and 51
For 485
three 12
I 4330
little 6
of 111
him 9
but 82
on 86
the 194
decease 5

must 28
now 10

For 485

Chapter 3
If 8
Elizabeth 5
when 6
Mr 5
gave 4
her 182
the 194
letter 20
did 23
not 85
expect 20
it 67
to 805
contain 16
a 6807
renewal 3
of 111
his 43
she 199
had 11
no 896
expectation 3
at 272
all 162
of 111
But 82
as 509
they 5
were 5
it 67
may 49
well 24
be 1205
how 27
she 199
through 4
them 9
and 51
what 14
a 6807
of 111
emotion 12
they 5
Her 182
as 509
she 199
read 49
were 5
to 805
be 1205
With 34
did 23
she 199
first 8
understand 8
that 11
he 963
any 17
to 805
be 1205
in 2719
his 43
power 19
and 51
was 93
she 199
that 11
he 963
have 11
no 896
explanation 3
to 805
give 15
a 6807
just 24
sense 8
of 111
shame 14
would 5
not 85
conceal 10
With 34
a 6807
strong 16
prejudice 4
he 963
might 9
say 7
she 199
his 43
account 14
of 111
what 14
had 11
at 272
She 199
read 49
with 34
an 972
left 19
her 182
power 19
of 111
comprehension 3
and 51
impatience 3
of 111
knowing 3
what 14
the 194
sentence 4
might 9
bring 6
was 93
of 111
to 805
the 194
sense 8
of 111
the 194
one 19
her 182
eyes 8
His 43
belief 3
of 111
her 182
she 199
to 805
be 1205
false 12
and 51
his 43
account 14
of 111
the 194
real 47
the 194
worst 6
to 805
the 194
match 25
made 13
her 182
too 50
to 805
have 11
any 17
wish 13
of 111
doing 3
him 9
justice 3
He 963
no 896
regret 9
for 485
what 14
he 963
had 11
done 3
her 182
his 43
style 4
was 93
not 85
penitent 8
but 82
It 67
was 93
all 162
pride 6
and 51
But 82
when 6
this 6
subject 11
was 93
by 57
his 43
account 14
of 111
Mr 5
when 6
she 199
read 49
with 34
attention 3
a 6807
relation 8
of 111
if 8
true 9
must 28
overthrow 5
every 10
opinion 4
of 111
his 43
worth 15
and 51
bore 13
so 797
an 972
to 805
his 43
own 9
of 111
her 182
were 5
yet 4
more 11
painful 6
and 51
more 11
difficult 5
of 111
definition 3
apprehension 3
and 51
even 36
horror 3
her 182
She 199
to 805
discredit 7
it 67
This 6
must 28
be 1205
false 12
This 6
be 1205
This 6
must 28
be 1205
the 194
falsehood 3
and 51
when 6
she 199
had 11
gone 4
through 4
the 194
whole 26
letter 20
though 12
knowing 3
anything 3
of 111
the 194
last 7
page 15
or 333
two 14
put 47
it 67
that 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
regard 7
it 67
that 11
she 199
would 5
never 3
look 14
in 2719
it 67
In 2719
this 6
state 41
of 111
mind 25
with 34
that 11
rest 110
on 86
nothing 5
she 199
on 86
but 82
it 67
would 5
not 85
do 814
in 2719
half 23
a 6807
minute 13
the 194
letter 20
was 93
and 51
as 509
well 24
as 509
she 199
she 199
the 194
perusal 3
of 111
all 162
that 11
related 3
to 805
and 51
so 797
far 91
as 509
to 805
examine 6
the 194
meaning 11
of 111
every 10
sentence 4
The 194
account 14
of 111
his 43
connection 3
with 34
the 194
was 93
what 14
he 963
had 11
related 3
and 51
the 194
kindness 3
of 111
the 194
late 23
Mr 5
though 12
she 199
had 11
not 85
extent 3
well 24
with 34
his 43
own 9
words 5
So 797
far 91
recital 6
the 194
other 6
but 82
when 6
she 199
came 36
to 805
the 194
will 40
the 194
difference 3
was 93
great 12
What 14
had 11
of 111
the 194
living 5
was 93
fresh 22
in 2719
her 182
and 51
as 509
she 199
his 43
words 5
it 67
was 93
not 85
to 805
feel 11
that 11
there 21
was 93
gross 10
on 86
one 19
side 74
or 333
the 194
other 6
and 51
for 485
a 6807
few 6
she 199
that 11
her 182
did 23
not 85
err 22
But 82
when 6
she 199
read 49
and 51
re 3836
read 49
with 34
the 194
attention 3
the 194
following 3
of 111
all 162
to 805
the 194
living 5
of 111
his 43
in 2719
lieu 8
so 797
a 6807
sum 70
as 509
three 12
thousand 7
was 93
she 199
to 805
hesitate 3
She 199
put 47
down 90
the 194
letter 20
every 10
circumstance 4
with 34
what 14
she 199
meant 3
to 805
be 1205
on 86
the 194
of 111
statement 5
but 82
with 34
little 6
success 13
On 86
both 8
sides 23
it 67
was 93
assertion 3
she 199
read 49
on 86
but 82
every 10
line 36
more 11
that 11
the 194
affair 3
she 199
had 11
it 67
that 11
any 17
contrivance 3
so 797
represent 11
as 509
to 805
render 7
Mr 5
conduct 21
in 2719
it 67
less 19
than 22
was 93
of 111
a 6807
turn 46
must 28
make 17
him 9
blameless 4
the 194
whole 26
The 194
extravagance 3
and 51
general 22
he 963
not 85
to 805
lay 42
at 272
Mr 5
charge 8
her 182
the 194
more 11
so 797
as 509
she 199
bring 6
no 896
proof 11
of 111
injustice 3
She 199
had 11
never 3
of 111
him 9
his 43
entrance 6
into 26
the 194
shire 3
Militia 6
in 2719
he 963
had 11
at 272
the 194
persuasion 3
of 111
the 194
young 10
man 343
who 79
on 86
meeting 6
him 9
in 2719
town 27
had 11
there 21
a 6807
slight 11
acquaintance 5
Of 111
his 43
former 3
way 27
of 111
life 44
nothing 5
had 11
in 2719
but 82
what 14
he 963
As 509
to 805
his 43
real 47
character 17
had 11
information 3
in 2719
her 182
power 19
she 199
had 11
never 3
felt 5
a 6807
wish 13
of 111
His 43
countenance 4
voice 8
and 51
manner 8
had 11
him 9
at 272
in 2719
the 194
possession 3
of 111
every 10
virtue 3
She 199
to 805
recollect 7
some 30
instance 4
of 111
some 30
trait 8
of 111
or 333
benevolence 3
that 11
might 9
rescue 7
him 9
the 194
of 111
Mr 5
or 333
at 272
least 3
by 57
the 194
of 111
virtue 3
atone 5
for 485
casual 9
under 288
she 199
would 5
endeavour 4
to 805
class 44
what 14
Mr 5
had 11
as 509
the 194
and 51
vice 14
of 111
continuance 3
But 82
no 896
recollection 3
her 182
She 199
see 70
him 9
her 182
in 2719
every 10
charm 14
of 111
air 129
and 51
address 9
but 82
she 199
remember 4
no 896
more 11
good 28
than 22
the 194
general 22
approbation 3
of 111
the 194
and 51
the 194
regard 7
his 43
social 19
had 11
him 9
in 2719
the 194
mess 31
After 48
on 86
this 6
point 22
a 6807
while 4
she 199
more 11
to 805
read 49
But 82
alas 6
the 194
story 13
of 111
his 43
on 86
Miss 71
some 30
confirmation 3
what 14
had 11
Colonel 5
and 51
the 194
morning 3
and 51
at 272
last 7
she 199
was 93
for 485
the 194
truth 7
of 111
every 10
particular 13
to 805
Colonel 5
whom 3
she 199
had 11
the 194
information 3
of 111
his 43
near 15
concern 6
in 2719
all 162
his 43
and 51
character 17
she 199
had 11
no 896
reason 13
to 805
question 16
At 272
one 19
time 45
she 199
had 11
on 86
to 805
him 9
but 82
the 194
idea 21
was 93
by 57
the 194
of 111
the 194
application 3
and 51
at 272
length 14
by 57
the 194
conviction 3
that 11
Mr 5
would 5

Aye 4

You 30

if 8
he 963
I 4331
dare 15

When 6

Lord 13
how 27
I 4331

And 51
that 11
made 13
the 194

suspect 5
something 3

then 5
they 5
soon 3
found 18
out 365
what 14

the 194
matter 7
With 34
of 111
of 111

companions 3
all 162
the 194

Elizabeth 5
as 509
little 6
as 509
she 199
but 82
there 21

no 896
the 194
frequent 9
mention 5
of 111
name 17
reception 6
at 272
home 90
was 93
most 3
kind 31
Bennet 4
to 805
see 70
Jane 9
in 2720
and 51
more 11
than 22
dinner 9
did 23
Mr 5
Bennet 4
say 7
to 805
Elizabeth 5
I 4331
am 394
glad 30
you 30
are 12
come 36
back 182
party 3
in 2720
the 194
room 22
was 93
large 11
for 486
all 162
the 194
came 36
to 805
meet 9
Maria 12
and 51
hear 76
the 194
news 71
and 51
were 5
the 194
that 11
them 9
Lady 18
Lucas 3
was 93
of 111
Maria 12
after 48
the 194
and 51
of 111
her 182
daughter 4
Bennet 4
was 93
on 86
one 19
hand 137
an 972
account 14
of 111
the 194
present 20
Jane 9
who 79
sat 92
some 30
way 27
her 182
and 51
on 86
the 194
other 6
them 9
all 162
to 805
the 194
and 51
Lydia 5
in 2720
a 6807
voice 8
than 22
any 17
other 6
was 93
the 194
of 111
the 194
morning 3
to 805
who 79
would 5
hear 76
her 182
Oh 17
Mary 13
she 199
I 4331
wish 13
you 30
had 11
gone 4
with 34
us 70
for 486
we 446
had 11
fun 88
As 509
we 446
along 3
and 51
I 4331
up 194
the 194
blinds 5
and 51
there 21
was 93
in 2720
the 194
coach 11
and 51
I 4331
should 7
have 11
gone 4
so 797
all 162
the 194
way 27
if 8
had 11
not 85
sick 38
and 51
when 6
we 446
got 14
to 805
the 194
George 6
I 4331
do 814
think 8
we 446
for 486
we 446
the 194
other 6
three 12
with 34
the 194
cold 9
luncheon 6
in 2720
the 194
world 12
and 51
if 8
you 30
would 5
have 11
gone 4
we 446
would 5
have 11
you 30
too 50
And 51
then 5
when 6
we 446
came 36
it 67
was 93
fun 88
I 4331
thought 11
we 446
never 3
should 7
have 11
got 14
into 26
the 194
coach 11
I 4331
was 93
to 805
die 38
of 111
And 51
then 5
we 446
were 5
so 797
merry 6
all 162
the 194
way 27
home 90
we 446
and 51
so 797
loud 16
that 11
might 9
have 11
us 70
ten 151
miles 4
off 102
To 805
this 6
Mary 13
Far 91
be 1205
it 67
me 1043
my 90
dear 15
sister 10
to 805
depreciate 3
They 5
would 5
be 1205
congenial 4
with 34
the 194
of 111
female 5
minds 4
But 82
I 4331
confess 14
they 5
would 5
have 11
no 896
for 486
me 1043
I 4331
should 7
prefer 13
a 6807
book 69
But 82
of 111
this 6
answer 8
Lydia 5
not 85
a 6807
word 26
She 199
to 805
for 486
more 11
than 22
half 23
a 6807
minute 13
and 51
never 3
to 805
Mary 13
at 272
all 162
In 2720
the 194
afternoon 3
Lydia 5
was 93
with 34
the 194
rest 110
of 111
the 194

walk 25
to 805
and 51
to 805
see 70
how 27
on 86
but 82
Elizabeth 5
the 194
scheme 7
It 67
should 7
not 85
be 1205
that 11
the 194
Miss 71
not 85
be 1205
at 272
home 90
half 23
a 6807
day 27
they 5
were 5
in 2720
pursuit 3
of 111
the 194

was 93
reason 13
too 50
for 486
her 182
opposition 3
She 199
Mr 5
and 51
was 93
to 805
avoid 8
it 67
as 509
long 50
as 509
possible 3
The 194
comfort 14
to 805
her 182
of 111
the 194
removal 3
was 93
expression 11
In 2720
a 6807
fortnight 4

on 86
his 43
account 14
She 199
had 11
not 85

home 90
she 199
found 18
that 11
the 194
scheme 7
of 111
Lydia 5
had 11
given 3
them 9
a 6807
hint 13
at 272
the 194
inn 59
was 93
under 288
frequent 9
discussion 3
her 182
Elizabeth 5
saw 24
that 11
her 182
father 12
had 11
not 85
the 194
intention 5
of 111
but 82
his 43
were 5
at 272
the 194
same 5
time 45
so 797
vague 6
and 51
equivocal 4
that 11

though 12
often 4
had 11
never 3
yet 4

to 805
acquaint 9
Jane 9
with 34
what 14

at 272
length 14
to 805
suppress 13
every 10
particular 13

any 17

appear 7
natural 18
and 51
all 162
surprise 4
was 93
in 2720
other 6
She 199
was 93
that 11
Mr 5
should 7
have 11
his 43
in 2720
a 6807
manner 8
so 797
little 6
to 805
recommend 8
them 9
but 82
still 13
more 11
was 93
she 199
for 486
the 194
her 182
refusal 3
must 28
have 11
given 3
him 9
His 43
being 3
so 797
sure 11
of 111
was 93
wrong 24
she 199
and 51
not 85
to 805
have 11
but 82
consider 13
how 27
it 67
must 28
increase 4
his 43
disappointment 3
Elizabeth 5
I 4331
am 394
for 486
him 9
but 82
he 963
has 41
other 6
will 40
soon 3
drive 18
his 43
regard 7
for 486
me 1043
You 30
do 814
not 85
blame 13
me 1043
for 486
him 9
Blame 13
you 30
Oh 17
no 896
But 82
you 30
blame 13
me 1043
for 486
so 797
of 111
No 896
I 4331
do 814
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 30
were 5
wrong 24
in 2720
saying 3
what 14
you 30
did 23
But 82
you 30
will 40
know 12
it 67
when 6
I 4331
tell 16
you 30
what 14
the 194
day 27
She 199
then 5
spoke 14
of 111
the 194
letter 20
the 194
whole 26
of 111
as 509
far 91
as 509
they 5
George 6
What 14
a 6807
stroke 4
was 93
this 6
for 486
poor 11
Jane 9
who 79
would 5
have 11
gone 4
through 4
the 194
world 12
that 11
so 797
in 2720
the 194
whole 26
race 24
of 111
as 509
was 93
here 31
in 2720
one 19
individual 19
Nor 102
was 93
vindication 3
though 12
grateful 4
to 805
her 182
of 111
her 182
for 486
Most 3
did 23
she 199
to 805
prove 21
the 194
of 111
error 3
and 51
seek 6
to 805
clear 23
the 194
one 19
the 194
other 6
This 6
will 40
not 85
do 814
Elizabeth 5
you 30
never 3
will 40
be 1205
able 3
to 805
make 17
both 8
of 111
them 9
good 28
for 486
anything 3
Take 18
your 4
choice 5
but 82
you 30
must 28
be 1205
with 34
one 19
There 21
is 124
but 82
a 6807
of 111
merit 13
them 9
just 24
to 805
make 17
one 19
good 28
sort 14
of 111
man 343
and 51
of 111
late 23
it 67
has 41
pretty 3
For 486
my 90
part 102
I 4331
am 394
to 805
believe 6
it 67
all 162
but 82
you 30
shall 12
do 814
as 509
you 30
choose 5
It 67
was 93
some 30
time 45
a 6807
smile 7
be 1205
Jane 9
I 4331
do 814
not 85
know 12
when 6
I 4331
have 11
more 11
she 199
so 797
bad 33
It 67
is 124
past 71
belief 3
And 51
poor 11
Mr 5
Dear 15
consider 13
what 14
he 963
must 28
have 11
a 6807
disappointment 3
and 51
with 34
the 194
knowledge 4
of 111
your 4
ill 84
opinion 4
too 50
and 51
to 805
relate 8
a 6807
thing 15
of 111
his 43
sister 10
It 67
is 124
too 50
I 4331
am 394
sure 11
you 30
must 28
feel 11
it 67
so 797
Oh 17
no 896
my 90
regret 9
and 51
compassion 4
are 12
all 162
done 3
by 57
you 30
so 797
full 16
of 111
both 8
I 4331
know 12
you 30
will 40
do 814
him 9
ample 3
justice 3
that 11
I 4331
am 394
every 10
moment 15
more 11
and 51
Your 4
profusion 3
makes 4
me 1043
saving 4
and 51
if 8
you 30
lament 10
over 598
him 9
my 90
heart 57
will 40
be 1205
as 509
light 42
as 509
a 6807
feather 15
Poor 11
there 21
is 124
an 972
expression 11
of 111
in 2720
his 43
countenance 4
an 972
and 51
in 2720
his 43
manner 8
There 21
was 93
some 30
great 12
in 2720
the 194
education 9
of 111
two 14
young 10
men 140
One 19
has 41
got 14
all 162
the 194
and 51
the 194
other 6
all 162
the 194
appearance 3
of 111
it 67
I 4331
never 3
thought 11
Mr 5
so 797
in 2720
the 194
appearance 3
of 111
it 67
as 509
you 30
to 805
do 814
And 51
yet 4
I 4331
meant 3
to 805
be 1205
clever 6
in 2720
taking 4
so 797
a 6807
dislike 4
to 805
him 9
any 17
reason 13
It 67
is 124
a 6807
spur 20
to 805
genius 3
an 972
opening 3
for 486
wit 77
to 805
have 11
a 6807
dislike 4
of 111
that 11
kind 31
One 19
may 49
be 1205
abusive 4
saying 3
anything 3
just 24
but 82
one 19
be 1205
laughing 6
at 272
a 6807
man 343
now 10
and 51
then 5
on 86
something 3
when 6
you 30
first 8
read 49
that 11
letter 20
I 4331
am 394
sure 11
you 30
not 85
treat 15
the 194
matter 7
as 509
you 30
do 814
now 10
I 4331
not 85
I 4331
was 93
I 4331
may 49
say 7
And 51
with 34
no 896
one 19
to 805
speak 12
to 805
what 14
I 4331
felt 5
no 896
Jane 9
to 805
comfort 14
me 1043
and 51
say 7
that 11
I 4331
had 11
not 85
so 797
weak 20
and 51
vain 8
and 51
as 509
I 4331
I 4331
had 11
Oh 17
how 27
I 4331
you 30
How 27
unfortunate 4
that 11
you 30
should 7
have 11
strong 16
in 2720
of 111
to 805
Mr 5
for 486
now 10
they 5
do 814
appear 7
But 82
the 194
misfortune 3
of 111
with 34
is 124
a 6807
most 3
natural 18
consequence 3
of 111
the 194
I 4331
had 11
There 21
is 124
one 19
point 22
on 86
I 4331
want 13
your 4
I 4331
want 13
to 805
be 1205
I 4331
or 333
not 85
to 805
make 17
our 3
acquaintances 3
in 2720
general 22
understand 8
character 17
Miss 71
Bennet 4
a 6807
little 6
and 51
then 5
there 21
can 288
be 1205
no 896
occasion 7
for 486
him 9
so 797
What 14
is 124
your 4
opinion 4
That 11
it 67
not 85
to 805
be 1205
Mr 5
has 41
not 85
me 1043
to 805
make 17
his 43
communication 3
public 18
On 86
the 194
every 10
particular 13
relative 4
to 805
his 43
sister 10
was 93
meant 3
to 805
be 1205
as 509
as 509
possible 3
to 805
and 51
if 8
I 4331
endeavour 4
to 805
undeceive 3
people 4
as 509
to 805
the 194
rest 110
of 111
his 43
conduct 21
who 79
will 40
believe 6
me 1043
The 194
general 22
prejudice 4
Mr 5
is 124
so 797
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1205
the 194
death 19
of 111
half 23
the 194
good 28
people 4
in 2720
to 805
attempt 5
to 805
place 29
him 9
in 2720
an 972
light 42
I 4331
am 394
not 85
equal 17
to 805
it 67
will 40
soon 3
be 1205
gone 4
and 51
it 67
will 40
not 85
to 805
here 31
what 14
he 963
is 124
Some 30
time 45
hence 3
it 67
will 40
be 1205
all 162
found 18
out 365
and 51
then 5
we 446
may 49
laugh 14
at 272
in 2720
not 85
knowing 3
it 67
At 272
present 20
I 4331
will 40
say 7
nothing 5
it 67
You 30
are 12
right 31
To 805
have 11
his 43
made 13
public 18
might 9
ruin 10
him 9
for 486
ever 33
He 963
is 124
now 10
for 486
what 14
he 963
has 41
done 3
and 51
anxious 4
to 805
re 3836
establish 7
a 6807
character 17
We 446
must 28
not 85
make 17
him 9
desperate 4
The 194
tumult 5
of 111
mind 25
was 93
by 57
this 6
conversation 8
She 199
had 11
got 14
rid 42
of 111
two 14
of 111
the 194
had 11
on 86
her 182
for 486
a 6807
fortnight 4
and 51
was 93
certain 5
of 111
a 6807
willing 4
listener 3
in 2720
Jane 9
she 199
might 9
wish 13
to 805
talk 18
of 111
But 82
there 21
was 93
still 13
something 3
behind 4
of 111
the 194
disclosure 3
She 199
dared 6
not 85
relate 8
the 194
other 6
half 23
of 111
Mr 5
letter 20
nor 102
explain 5
to 805
her 182
sister 10
how 27
she 199
had 11
by 57
her 182
friend 15
Here 31
was 93
knowledge 4
in 2720
no 896
one 19
partake 6
and 51
she 199
was 93
sensible 3
that 11
nothing 5
less 19
than 22
a 6807
perfect 24
understanding 4
the 194
her 182
in 2720
off 102
this 6
last 7
encumbrance 3
of 111
And 51
then 5
she 199
if 8
that 11
event 18
should 7
ever 33
take 18
place 29
I 4331
shall 12
be 1205
able 3
to 805
tell 16
what 14
Bingley 4
may 49
tell 16
in 2720
a 6807
more 11
agreeable 3
manner 8
The 194
of 111
communication 3
be 1205
mine 26
till 14
it 67
has 41
all 162
value 8
She 199
was 93
now 10
on 86
being 3
at 272
home 90
at 272
leisure 8
to 805
observe 6
the 194
real 47
state 41
of 111
her 182
Jane 9
was 93
not 85
She 199
still 13
a 6807
tender 27
affection 5
for 486
Bingley 4
never 3
even 36
in 2720
love 30
her 182
regard 7
had 11
all 162
the 194
of 111
first 8
attachment 3
and 51
her 182
age 24
and 51
disposition 3
than 22
most 3
first 8
often 4
boast 12
and 51
so 797
did 23
she 199
value 8
his 43
remembrance 3
and 51
prefer 13
him 9
to 805
every 10
other 6
man 343
that 11
all 162
her 182
good 28
sense 8
and 51
all 162
her 182
attention 3
to 805
the 194
of 111
her 182
friends 5
were 5
requisite 3
to 805
check 40
the 194
indulgence 3
of 111
must 28
have 11
to 805
her 182
own 9
health 12
and 51
Well 24
Bennet 4
one 19
day 27
what 14
is 124
your 4
opinion 4
now 10
of 111
this 6
sad 47
business 13
of 111
For 486
my 90
part 102
I 4331
am 394
never 3
to 805
speak 12
of 111
it 67
to 805
I 4331
my 90
sister 10
Phillips 3
so 797
the 194
other 6
day 27
But 82
I 4331
find 10
out 365
that 11
Jane 9
saw 24
anything 3
of 111
him 9
in 2720
London 5
Well 24
he 963
is 124
a 6807
young 10
man 343
and 51
I 4331
do 814
not 85
suppose 4
the 194
least 3
chance 20
in 2720
the 194
world 12
of 111
her 182
ever 33
him 9
now 10
There 21
is 124
no 896
talk 18
of 111
his 43
coming 3
to 805
in 2720
the 194
summer 13
and 51
I 4331
have 11
of 111
too 50
who 79
is 124
to 805
know 12
I 4331
do 814
not 85
believe 6
he 963
will 40
ever 33
live 43
at 272
any 17
more 11
Oh 17
well 24
it 67
is 124
just 24
as 509
he 963
him 9
to 805
come 36
Though 12
I 4331
shall 12
say 7
he 963
my 90
daughter 4
ill 84
and 51
if 8
I 4331
was 93
her 182
I 4331
would 5
not 85
have 11
put 47
up 194
with 34
it 67
Well 24
my 90
comfort 14
is 124
I 4331
am 394
sure 11
Jane 9
will 40
die 38
of 111
a 6807
broken 6
heart 57
and 51
then 5
he 963
will 40
be 1205
for 486
what 14
he 963
has 41
done 3
But 82
as 509
Elizabeth 5
not 85
receive 8
comfort 14
any 17
expectation 3
she 199
made 13
no 896
answer 8
Well 24
her 182
mother 21
soon 3
and 51
so 797
the 194
live 43
comfortable 3
do 814
they 5
Well 24
well 24
I 4331
hope 16
it 67
will 40
last 7
And 51
what 14
sort 14
of 111
table 27
do 814
they 5
keep 11
Charlotte 4
is 124
an 972
manager 6
I 4331
dare 15
say 7
If 8
she 199
is 124
half 23
as 509
sharp 30
as 509
her 182
mother 21
she 199
is 124
saving 4
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
in 2720
I 4331
dare 15
say 7
No 896
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
A 6807
great 12
deal 13
of 111
good 28
management 3
depend 17
it 67
Yes 16
yes 16
They 5
will 40
take 18
care 47
not 85
to 805
outrun 3
income 5
They 5
will 40
never 3
be 1205
for 486
money 17
Well 24
good 28
may 49
it 67
do 814
them 9
And 51
so 797
I 4331
suppose 4
they 5
often 4
talk 18
of 111
when 6
your 4
father 12
is 124
dead 39
They 5
look 14
it 67
as 509
own 9
I 4331
dare 15
say 7
that 11
happens 4
It 67
was 93
a 6807
subject 11
they 5
not 85
mention 5
me 1043
No 896
it 67
would 5
have 11
strange 8
if 8
they 5
had 11
but 82
I 4331
make 17
no 896
doubt 15
they 5
often 4
talk 18
of 111
it 67
Well 24
if 8
they 5
can 288
be 1205
with 34
an 972
estate 3
that 11
is 124
not 85
own 9
so 797
the 194
better 7
I 4331
should 7
be 1205
of 111
one 19
that 11
was 93
on 86
me 1043
Chapter 3
The 194
first 8
week 20
of 111
return 14
was 93
soon 3
gone 4
The 194
second 16
It 67
was 93
the 194
last 7
of 111
the 194
stay 7
in 2720
and 51
all 162
the 194
young 10
in 2720
the 194
were 5
The 194

But 82
the 194
gloom 8
of 111
prospect 13
was 93
for 486
she 199
an 972

A 6807

as 509
in 2720
her 182

Lydia 5
that 11

as 509
the 194

of 111
all 162

more 11
with 34
a 6807
companion 10
at 272

the 194

He 964

has 41
in 2720
some 30

it 67
with 34
so 797
little 6
expense 3
or 333
inconvenience 4
to 805
her 182

If 8

Elizabeth 5
of 111
the 194

general 22
I 4331
am 394
now 10
Our 3

Excuse 4

If 8

she 199
will 40
soon 3
be 1205
the 194
reach 6
of 111
amendment 3
Her 182
character 17
will 40
be 1205

she 199
will 40
at 272
sixteen 6
be 1205
the 194
most 3
flirt 13
that 11
ever 33
made 13
or 333
her 182
ridiculous 4
a 6807
flirt 13
too 50
in 2720
the 194
worst 6
and 51
degree 3
of 111
flirtation 3
any 17
attraction 3
youth 7
and 51
a 6807

of 111
her 182

to 805
ward 19
off 102
any 17
portion 5
of 111
that 11
universal 10
contempt 8
her 182
rage 4
for 486
will 40
excite 10
In 2720
this 6
danger 7
also 3
is 124
She 199
will 40
follow 11
Lydia 5
Vain 8
idle 10
and 51
Oh 17
my 90
dear 15
father 12
can 288
you 30
suppose 4
it 67
possible 3
that 11
they 5
will 40
not 85
be 1205
and 51
they 5
are 12
and 51
that 11
will 40
not 85
be 1205
often 4
in 2720
the 194
disgrace 8
Mr 5
Bennet 4
saw 24
that 11
her 182
whole 26
heart 58
was 93
in 2720
the 194
subject 11
and 51
taking 4
her 182
hand 137
in 2720
reply 3
Do 814
not 85
make 17
my 90
love 30
you 30
and 51
Jane 9
are 12
you 30
must 28
be 1205
and 51
and 51
you 30
will 40
not 85
appear 7
to 805
less 19
advantage 6
for 486
a 6807
couple 7
of 111
or 333
I 4331
may 49
say 7
three 12
We 446
shall 12
have 11
no 896
peace 21
at 272
if 8
Lydia 5
does 5
not 85
go 500
to 805
Let 50
her 182
go 500
then 5
Colonel 5
is 124
a 6807
sensible 3
man 343
and 51
will 40
keep 11
her 182
out 365
of 111
any 17
real 47
and 51
she 199
is 124
too 50
poor 11
to 805
be 1205
an 972
object 26
of 111
prey 5
to 805
At 272
she 199
will 40
be 1205
of 111
less 19
even 36
as 509
a 6807
common 23
flirt 13
than 22
she 199
has 41
here 31
The 194
will 40
find 10
women 6
better 7
worth 15
notice 8
Let 50
us 70
hope 16
that 11
her 182
being 3
there 21
may 49
teach 9
her 182
her 182
own 9
At 272
any 17
rate 9
she 199
grow 21
worse 6
us 70
to 805
lock 32
her 182
up 194
for 486
the 194
rest 110
of 111
her 182
life 44
With 34
this 6
answer 8
Elizabeth 5
was 93
to 805
be 1205
content 18
but 82
her 182
own 9
opinion 4
the 194
same 5
and 51
she 199
left 19
him 9
and 51
It 67
was 93
not 85
in 2720
her 182
nature 5
to 805
increase 4
her 182
by 57
dwelling 3
on 86
them 9
She 199
was 93
confident 6
of 111
her 182
and 51
to 805
fret 14
over 598
or 333
augment 11
them 9
by 57
was 93
no 896
part 102
of 111
her 182
disposition 3
Had 11
Lydia 5
and 51
her 182
mother 21
the 194
substance 3
of 111
her 182
conference 3
with 34
her 182
father 12
would 5
have 11
found 18
expression 11
in 2720
In 2720
imagination 3
a 6808
visit 14
to 805
every 10
of 111
She 199
saw 24
with 34
the 194
creative 6
eye 57
of 111
fancy 5
the 194
of 111
that 11
gay 9
place 29
with 34
She 199
saw 24
the 194
object 26
of 111
attention 3
to 805
tens 19
and 51
to 805
of 111
them 9
at 272
present 20
unknown 3
She 199
saw 24
all 162
the 194
of 111
the 194
camp 48
forth 8
in 2720
of 111
lines 4
with 34
the 194
young 10
and 51
the 194
gay 9
and 51
with 34
and 51
to 805
complete 8
the 194
view 18
she 199
saw 24
a 6808
tent 20
with 34
at 272
least 3
six 24
at 272
Had 11
she 199
her 182
sister 10
to 805
tear 26
her 182
and 51
as 509
these 4
what 14
would 5
have 11
her 182
They 5
have 11
by 57
her 182
mother 21
who 79
might 9
have 11
felt 5
the 194
same 5
going 3
to 805
was 93
all 162
that 11
her 182
for 486
her 182
conviction 3
of 111
her 182
never 3
to 805
go 500
there 21
But 82
they 5
were 5
of 111
what 14
had 11
and 51
with 34
little 6
intermission 3
to 805
the 194
day 27
of 111
leaving 3
home 90
Elizabeth 5
was 93
now 10
to 805
see 70
Mr 5
for 486
the 194
last 7
time 45
in 2720
with 34
him 9
since 7
her 182
return 14
agitation 3
was 93
pretty 3
well 24
over 598
the 194
of 111
former 3
so 797
She 199
had 11
even 36
to 805
detect 13
in 2720
the 194
had 11
first 8
her 182
an 972
affectation 3
and 51
a 6808
to 805
disgust 7
and 51
In 2720
his 43
present 20
to 805
she 199
had 11
a 6808
fresh 22
source 4
of 111
for 486
the 194
inclination 3
he 964
soon 3
of 111
had 11
the 194
part 102
of 111
acquaintance 5
serve 9
after 48
what 14
had 11
since 7
to 805
provoke 6
her 182
She 199
all 162
concern 6
for 486
him 9
in 2720
finding 4
as 509
the 194
object 26
of 111
idle 10
and 51
frivolous 4
and 51
while 4
she 199
it 67
not 85
but 82
feel 11
the 194
reproof 5
in 2720
his 43
that 11
long 50
and 51
for 486
cause 14
his 43
had 11
her 182
would 5
be 1205
and 51
her 182
preference 3
at 272
any 17
time 45
by 57
renewal 3
On 86
the 194
last 7
day 27
of 111
the 194
at 272
he 964
with 34
other 6
of 111
the 194
at 272
and 51
so 797
little 6
was 93
Elizabeth 5
to 805
part 102
him 9
in 2720
good 28
that 11
on 86
his 43
making 4
some 30
as 509
to 805
the 194
manner 8
in 2720
her 182
time 45
had 11
at 272
she 199
Colonel 5
and 51
Mr 5
both 8
three 12
at 272
and 51
him 9
if 8
he 964
was 93
with 34
the 194
former 3
He 964
but 82
with 34
a 6808
recollection 3
and 51
a 6808
smile 7
that 11
he 964
had 11
him 9
often 4
and 51
after 48
that 11
he 964
was 93
a 6808
man 343
her 182
how 27
she 199
had 11
him 9
Her 182
answer 8
was 93
in 2720
his 43
favour 7
With 34
an 972
air 129
of 111
he 964
soon 3
How 27
long 50
did 23
you 30
say 7
he 964
was 93
at 272
three 12
And 51
you 30
saw 24
him 9
Yes 16
every 10
day 27
His 43
are 12
different 11
his 43
Yes 16
different 11
But 82
I 4331
think 8
Mr 5
acquaintance 5
Mr 5
with 34
a 6808
look 14
did 23
not 85
escape 10
her 182
And 51
pray 9
may 49
I 4331
ask 6
But 82
he 964
in 2720
a 6808
tone 12
Is 124
it 67
in 2720
address 9
that 11
he 964
Has 41
he 964
to 805
add 54
aught 3
of 111
to 805
his 43
style 4
for 486
I 4331
dare 15
not 85
hope 16
he 964
in 2720
a 6808

Oh 17

Elizabeth 5
In 2720
I 4331
believe 6
he 964
is 124
what 14
he 964
ever 33
was 93
While 4
she 199
spoke 14
as 509
if 8
knowing 3
to 805
rejoice 3
over 598
her 182
words 5
or 333
to 805
distrust 7
meaning 11
There 21
was 93
a 6808
something 3
in 2720
her 182
countenance 4
made 13
him 9
listen 9
with 34
an 972
apprehensive 4
and 51
anxious 4
attention 3
while 4
she 199
When 6
I 4331
that 11
he 964
on 86
acquaintance 5
I 4331
did 23
not 85
mean 36
that 11
his 43
mind 25
or 333
his 43
were 5
in 2720
a 6808
state 41
of 111
improvement 3
but 82
that 11
knowing 3
him 9
better 7
his 43
disposition 3
was 93
better 7
alarm 9
now 10
in 2720
a 6808
complexion 5
and 51
look 14
for 486
a 6808

minutes 3
he 964
was 93

off 102
his 43

You 30
who 79
so 797
well 24
know 12
my 90
feeling 4
Mr 5
will 40
comprehend 4
how 27
I 4331
must 28
rejoice 3
that 11
he 964
is 124
wise 17
to 805
assume 3
even 36
the 194
appearance 3
of 111
what 14
is 124
right 31
His 43
pride 6
in 2720
that 11
direction 5
may 49
be 1205
of 111
service 13
if 8
not 85
to 805
to 805
for 486
it 67
must 28
deter 39
him 9
foul 13
misconduct 5
as 509
I 4331
have 11
by 57
I 4331
fear 14
that 11
the 194
sort 14
of 111
to 805
you 30
I 4331
imagine 3
have 11
is 124
on 86
his 43

his 43
aunt 6
of 111
good 28
opinion 4
and 51
he 964
stands 4
in 2720
awe 10
His 43
fear 14
of 111
her 182
has 41
I 4331
know 12
when 6
they 5
were 5
together 3
and 51
a 6808
good 28
deal 13
is 124
to 805
be 1205
to 805
his 43
wish 13
of 111
the 194
match 25
with 34
Miss 71
de 2456
I 4331
am 394
certain 5
he 964
has 41
at 272
heart 58
Elizabeth 5
not 85
repress 10
a 6808
smile 7
at 272
this 6
but 82
she 199
by 57
a 6808
slight 11
inclination 3
of 111
the 194
head 140
She 199
saw 24
that 11
he 964

engage 6
her 182
on 86
the 194
old 21
subject 11
of 111
his 43

she 199
was 93
in 2720
no 896

indulge 8
him 9
The 194
rest 110
of 111
the 194
evening 3
with 34
the 194
appearance 3
on 86
his 43
side 74
of 111
usual 3
but 82
with 34
no 896
further 8
attempt 5
to 805
distinguish 5
Elizabeth 5
and 51
they 5
at 272
last 7
with 34
mutual 4
and 51
a 6808
mutual 4
desire 6
of 111
never 3
meeting 6
When 6
the 194

broke 15
up 194
Lydia 5
with 34

they 5
were 5

The 194
separation 3
her 182
and 51
her 182
was 93
than 22
was 93
the 194

who 79
shed 4

she 199

weep 14
vexation 3
and 51
envy 4
Bennet 4
was 93
diffuse 6
in 2720
her 182
good 28
for 486
the 194
of 111
her 182
daughter 4
and 51
impressive 4
in 2720
her 182
that 11
she 199
should 7
not 85
miss 71
the 194
of 111
as 509
as 509
possible 3
there 21
was 93
every 10
reason 13

Her 182

But 82
Mr 5
Bennet 4
was 93
not 85
of 111
a 6808
disposition 3
to 805
seek 6
comfort 14
for 486
the 194

too 50
often 4

the 194
unfortunate 4
for 486

He 964
was 93
fond 17
of 111
the 194
country 12

To 805
his 43

little 6
indebted 3

This 6
is 124
not 85
the 194

of 111
a 6808
man 343
would 5
in 2720
general 22
wish 13

but 82
where 21

Elizabeth 5

never 3
blind 22
to 805
the 194

her 182
as 509
a 6808
husband 10
She 199
had 11
it 67
with 34
pain 42
but 82
his 43

grateful 4
for 486
his 43
treatment 3
of 111

to 805
forget 8
what 14
she 199
not 85
overlook 5
and 51
to 805
banish 6
her 182
that 11
breach 5

in 2720
his 43

the 194
contempt 8
of 111

was 93
so 797
But 82
she 199
had 11
never 3
felt 5
so 797
as 509
now 10
the 194

attend 15
the 194

When 6
Elizabeth 5
had 11
over 598

she 199
found 18
little 6
other 6
cause 14
for 486
satisfaction 3
in 2720
the 194
loss 3
of 111
the 194

less 19

at 272

Her 182

now 10
the 194
object 26
of 111
her 182

in 2720
the 194
scheme 7
every 10

But 82
it 67
is 124
thought 11
she 199
that 11
I 4331
have 11
something 3

Were 5
the 194

But 82
here 31

absence 3
I 4331
may 49
hope 16
to 805

all 162

pleasure 5
A 6808
scheme 7

never 3

general 22
disappointment 3
is 124
off 102
by 57
the 194
of 111
some 30
little 6
peculiar 5
vexation 3
When 6
Lydia 5
she 199

often 4
and 51
to 805
her 182

short 62
to 805
her 182

that 11
they 5
were 5
just 24
the 194
where 21

where 21
she 199

her 182
wild 36
that 11
she 199
had 11
a 6808
new 115
gown 5
or 333
a 6808
new 115
parasol 3
she 199
would 5
have 11
more 11
but 82
was 93
to 805
leave 14
off 102
in 2720
a 6808
hurry 3
as 509
her 182

they 5
were 5
going 3
off 102
to 805
the 194

that 11
by 57
the 194

Christmas 9

was 93
to 805
assume 3

be 1205
better 7

felt 5
that 11

mistress 3
of 111

be 1205
something 3
They 5

Elizabeth 5

where 21
she 199

The 194
housekeeper 3
came 36
a 6808
woman 21
less 19
fine 17
and 51
more 11
civil 15
than 22

was 93
a 6808
large 11

up 194
Elizabeth 5
after 48
it 67
to 805
a 6808

to 805
enjoy 9
prospect 13
The 194
hill 22
with 34
wood 96
they 5
had 11
the 194
distance 4
was 93
a 6808
object 26
Every 10
disposition 3
of 111
the 194

was 93
good 28

every 10

were 5
to 805

The 194

handsome 6
and 51
suitable 3
to 805
the 194
fortune 8
of 111
proprietor 7
but 82
Elizabeth 5
saw 24
with 34
of 111
his 43
taste 15
that 11
it 67
was 93
nor 102
fine 17
with 34
less 19

more 11
real 48
than 22
the 194
of 111
And 51
of 111
this 6
place 29
thought 11
she 199
I 4331
might 9
have 11
mistress 3
With 34
these 4
I 4331
might 9
now 10
have 11
of 111
viewing 3
them 9
as 509
a 6808
stranger 3
I 4331
might 9
have 11
in 2720
them 9
as 509
my 90
own 9
and 51
to 805
them 9
as 509
my 90
uncle 18

aunt 6
But 82
no 896
that 11
never 3

have 11

This 6
was 93
a 6808
recollection 3

She 199
to 805
inquire 6
of 111
the 194

her 182
master 28
was 93
absent 14
but 82
had 11
not 85
the 194
courage 6
for 486

At 272
length 14
the 194
question 16
was 93
by 57
her 182
uncle 18

she 199
with 34
alarm 9
while 4
that 11
he 964

But 82
we 446
expect 20
him 9
to 805
morrow 3
with 34
a 6808
large 11
party 3
of 111
friends 5
How 27

this 6
was 93
going 3
pretty 3
far 91
and 51
she 199
with 34
as 509
the 194
housekeeper 3
I 4331
have 11
never 3
a 6808
cross 74
word 26
him 9
in 2720
my 90
life 44
and 51
I 4331
have 11
him 9
ever 33
since 7
he 964
was 93
four 26
old 21
This 6
was 93
praise 7
of 111
all 162
most 3
most 3
opposite 4
to 805
her 182
That 11
he 964
was 93
not 85
a 6808
good 28
man 343
had 11
her 182
opinion 4
Her 182
attention 3
was 93
she 199
to 805
hear 77
more 11
and 51
was 93
grateful 4
to 805
her 182
uncle 18
for 486
saying 3
There 21
are 12
few 6
people 4
of 111
whom 3
so 797
can 288
be 1205
You 30
are 12
in 2720
a 6808
master 28
Yes 16
sir 22
I 4331
know 12
I 4331
am 394
If 8
I 4331
were 5
to 805
go 500
through 4
the 194
world 12
I 4331
not 85
meet 9
with 34
a 6808
better 7
But 82
I 4331
have 11
that 11
they 5
who 79
are 12
good 28
when 6
are 12
good 28
when 6
they 5
grow 21
up 194
and 51
he 964
was 93
the 194
most 3
generous 4
boy 25
in 2720
the 194
world 12
Elizabeth 5
at 272
her 182
Can 288
this 6
be 1205
Mr 5
thought 11
she 199
His 43
father 12
was 93
an 972
man 343
Gardiner 3
Yes 16
that 11
he 965
was 93
and 51
his 43
son 70
will 40
be 1205
just 24
like 22
him 9
just 24
as 509
to 805
the 194
poor 11
Elizabeth 5
and 51
was 93
for 486
more 11
interest 6
her 182
on 86
no 896
other 6
point 22
She 199
related 3
the 194
of 111
the 194
pictures 5
the 194
of 111
the 194
and 51
the 194
price 6
of 111
the 194
in 2720
vain 8
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
by 57
the 194
kind 31
of 111
prejudice 4
to 805
he 965
her 182
commendation 3
of 111
her 182
master 28
soon 3
led 11
to 805
the 194
subject 11
and 51
she 199
with 34
on 86
his 43
as 509
they 5
together 3
up 194
the 194
great 12
staircase 3
He 965
is 124
the 194
best 37
landlord 3
and 51
the 194
best 37
master 28
she 199
that 11
ever 33
not 85
like 22
the 194
wild 36
young 10
men 140
who 79
think 8
of 111
nothing 5
but 82
There 21
is 124
not 85
one 19
of 111
his 43
or 333
but 82
will 40
give 15
him 9
a 6808
good 28
name 17
Some 30
people 4
call 57
him 9
proud 5
but 82
I 4331
am 394
sure 11
I 4331
never 3
saw 24
anything 3
of 111
it 67
To 805
my 90
fancy 5
it 67
is 124
he 965
does 5
not 85
rattle 17
like 22
other 6
young 10
men 140
In 2720
what 14
an 972
light 42
does 5
this 6
place 29
him 9
thought 11
Elizabeth 5
This 6
fine 17
account 14
of 111
him 9
her 182
aunt 6
as 509
they 5
is 124
not 85
with 34
his 43
to 805
our 3
poor 11
friend 15
we 446
might 9
be 1205
That 11
is 124
not 85
our 3
was 93
too 50
good 28
On 86
the 194
spacious 4
lobby 6
above 3
they 5
were 5
into 26
a 6808
pretty 3
sitting 3
room 22
up 194
with 34
and 51
than 22
the 194

were 5
that 11
it 67
was 93
but 82
just 24
done 3
to 805
give 15
pleasure 5
to 805
Miss 71
who 79
had 11
a 6808
to 805
the 194
room 22

He 965

Miss 71

when 6
she 199
should 7
enter 23
the 194
room 22
And 51
this 6
is 124
the 194
way 27
with 34
him 9
she 199
can 288
give 15
his 43
sister 10
any 17
pleasure 5
is 124
sure 11
to 805
be 1205
done 3
in 2720
a 6808
moment 15
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
he 965
would 5
not 85
do 815
for 486
her 182
The 194
picture 8
and 51
two 14
or 333
three 12
of 111
the 194
principal 7
were 5
all 162
that 11
to 805
be 1205
In 2720
the 194
former 3
were 5
good 28
but 82
Elizabeth 5
nothing 5
of 111
the 194
art 104
and 51
as 509
had 11
she 199
had 11
to 805
look 14
at 272
some 30
of 111
Miss 71
in 2720
were 5
more 11
and 51
also 3
more 11
In 2720
the 194
there 21
were 5
but 82
they 5
have 11
little 6
to 805
fix 27
the 194
attention 3
of 111
a 6808
stranger 3
Elizabeth 5
in 2720
quest 21
of 111
the 194
face 19
would 5
be 1205
to 805
her 182
At 272
last 7
it 67
her 182
and 51
she 199
a 6808
striking 3
resemblance 3
to 805
Mr 5
with 34
a 6808
smile 7
over 598
the 194
face 19
as 509
she 199
to 805
have 11
when 6
he 965
at 272
her 182
She 199
several 3
minutes 3
the 194
picture 8
in 2720
earnest 8
and 51
to 805
it 67
they 5
the 194
them 9
that 11
it 67
had 11
in 2720
his 43
lifetime 3
There 21
was 93
at 272
this 6
moment 15
in 2720
mind 25
a 6808
more 11
gentle 20
sensation 14
the 194
original 6
than 22
she 199
had 11
ever 33
felt 5
at 272
the 194
height 7
of 111
acquaintance 5
The 194
commendation 3
on 86
him 9
by 57
was 93
of 111
no 896
nature 5
What 14
praise 7
is 124
more 11
valuable 3
than 22
the 194
praise 7
of 111
an 972
intelligent 4
servant 3
As 509
a 6808
brother 9
a 6808
landlord 3
a 6808
master 28
she 199
how 27
were 5
in 2720
his 43
how 27
of 111
pleasure 5
or 333
pain 42
was 93
it 67
in 2720
his 43
power 19
to 805
bestow 7
how 27
of 111
good 28
or 333
evil 15
must 28
be 1205
done 3
by 57
him 9
Every 10
idea 21
that 11
had 11
forward 12
by 57
the 194
housekeeper 3
was 93
to 805
his 43
character 17
and 51
as 509
she 199
the 194
canvas 16
on 86
he 965
was 93
and 51
his 43
eyes 8
she 199
thought 11
of 111
his 43
regard 7
with 34
a 6808
sentiment 18
of 111
than 22
it 67
had 11
ever 33
she 199
and 51
of 111
expression 11
When 6
all 162
of 111
the 194
house 87
that 11
was 93
open 21
to 805
general 22
inspection 3

taking 4
leave 14
of 111
the 194

were 5
over 598
to 805
the 194

who 79
met 181

As 509

and 51
while 4
the 194
former 3
was 93
as 509
to 805
the 194
date 15
of 111
the 194
building 3
the 194
owner 5
of 111

behind 4

to 805
the 194
They 5
were 5
within 3
yards 4
of 111
other 6
and 51
so 797
abrupt 6
was 93
his 43
appearance 3
that 11
it 67
was 93
to 805
avoid 8
his 43
sight 17
eyes 8
met 181
and 51
the 194
of 111
both 8
were 5
overspread 3
with 34
the 194
blush 8
He 965
and 51
for 486
a 6808
moment 15
surprise 4
but 82
the 194
party 3
and 51
spoke 14
to 805
Elizabeth 5
if 8
not 85
in 2720
of 111
perfect 24
at 272
least 3
of 111
perfect 24
She 199
had 11
but 82
on 86
his 43
approach 6
his 43
with 34
an 972
embarrassment 3
to 805
be 1205
Had 11
his 43
first 8
appearance 3
or 333
his 43
resemblance 3
to 805
the 194
picture 8
they 5
had 11
just 24
to 805
assure 6
the 194
other 6
two 14
that 11
they 5
now 10
saw 24
Mr 5
the 194
expression 11
of 111
surprise 4
on 86
his 43
master 28
must 28
have 11
it 67
They 5
a 6808
little 6
aloof 4
while 4
he 965
was 93
to 805
niece 3
who 79
and 51
dared 6
lift 11
her 182
eyes 8
to 805
his 43
face 19
and 51
not 85
what 14
answer 8
she 199
to 805
his 43
civil 15
after 48
her 182
at 272
the 194
alteration 3
of 111
his 43
manner 8
since 7
they 5
last 7
every 10
sentence 4
that 11
he 965
was 93
her 182
embarrassment 3
and 51
every 10
idea 21
of 111
the 194
of 111
her 182
being 3
found 18
there 21
to 805
her 182
mind 25
the 194
few 6
minutes 3
in 2720
they 5
were 5
some 30
of 111
the 194
most 3
in 2720
her 182
life 44
Nor 102
did 23
he 965
seem 10
more 11
at 272
ease 10
when 6
he 965
spoke 14
his 43
accent 14
had 11
none 32
of 111
usual 3
and 51
he 965
his 43
as 509
to 805
the 194
time 45
of 111
her 182
left 19
and 51
of 111
her 182
in 2720
so 797
often 4
and 51
in 2720
so 797
a 6808
way 27
as 509
spoke 14
the 194
distraction 3
of 111
his 43
At 272
length 14
every 10
idea 21
to 805
fail 12
him 9
and 51
after 48
standing 3
a 6808
few 6
saying 3
a 6808
word 26
he 965
and 51
leave 14
The 194
then 5
her 182
and 51
of 111
his 43
figure 7
but 82
Elizabeth 5
not 85
a 6808
word 26
and 51
by 57
her 182
own 9
them 9
in 2720
silence 7
She 199
was 93
by 57
shame 14
and 51
vexation 3
Her 182
coming 3
there 21
was 93
the 194
most 3
unfortunate 4
the 194
most 3
ill 84
thing 15
in 2720
the 194
world 12
How 27
strange 8
it 67
must 28
appear 7
to 805
him 9
In 2720
what 14
a 6808
disgraceful 4
light 42
might 9
it 67
not 85
strike 14
so 797
vain 8
a 6808
man 343
It 67
might 9
seem 10
as 509
if 8
she 199
had 11
in 2720
his 43
way 27
Oh 17
why 4
did 23
she 199
come 36
Or 333
why 4
did 23
he 965
come 36
a 6808
day 27
he 965
was 93
Had 11
they 5
ten 151
minutes 3
they 5
should 7
have 11
the 194
reach 6
of 111
his 43
for 486
it 67
was 93
plain 27
that 11
he 965
was 93
that 11
moment 15
that 11
moment 15
his 43
horse 52
or 333
his 43
carriage 5
She 199
and 51
over 598
the 194
of 111
the 194
meeting 6
And 51
his 43
so 797
what 14
it 67
mean 36
That 11
he 965
should 7
even 36
speak 12
to 805
her 182
was 93
but 82
to 805
speak 12
with 34
to 805
inquire 6
after 48
her 182
Never 3
in 2720
her 182
life 44
had 11
she 199
his 43
so 797
little 6
never 3
had 11
he 965
with 34
as 509
on 86
this 6
unexpected 4
meeting 6
What 14
a 6808
contrast 5
did 23
it 67
offer 10
to 805
his 43
last 7
address 9
in 2720
Park 18
when 6
he 965
put 47
his 43
letter 20
into 26
her 182
hand 137
She 199
not 85
what 14
to 805
think 8
or 333
how 27
to 805
account 14
for 486
it 67
They 5
had 11
now 10
a 6808
walk 25
by 57
the 194
side 74
of 111
the 194
water 88
and 51
every 10
step 48
was 93
forward 12
a 6808
fall 29
of 111
ground 36
or 333
a 6808
finer 3
reach 6
of 111
the 194
woods 15
to 805
they 5
were 5
but 82
it 67
was 93
some 30
time 45
Elizabeth 5
was 93
sensible 3
of 111
any 17
of 111
it 67
and 51
though 12
she 199
to 805
the 194
of 111
her 182
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
and 51
to 805
direct 30
her 182
eyes 8
to 805
as 509
they 5
out 365
she 199
no 896
part 102
of 111
the 194
scene 5
Her 182
were 5
all 162
on 86
that 11
one 19
spot 24
of 111
House 87
it 67
might 9
be 1205
where 21
Mr 5
then 5
was 93
She 199
to 805
know 12
what 14
at 272
the 194
moment 15
was 93
passing 3
in 2720
his 43
mind 25
in 2720
what 14
manner 8
he 965
thought 11
of 111
her 182
and 51
in 2720
of 111
she 199
was 93
still 13
dear 15
to 805
him 9
he 965
had 11
civil 15
he 965
felt 5
at 272
ease 10
yet 4
there 21
had 11
that 11
in 2720
his 43
voice 8
was 93
not 85
like 22
ease 10
he 965
had 11
felt 5
more 11
of 111
pain 42
or 333
of 111
pleasure 5
in 2720
her 182
she 199
not 85
tell 16
but 82
he 965
had 11
not 85
her 182
with 34
At 272
length 14
the 194
of 111
her 182
companions 3
on 86
her 182
absence 3
of 111
mind 25
her 182
and 51
she 199
felt 5
the 194
of 111
more 11
like 22
They 5
the 194
woods 15
and 51
adieu 3
to 805
the 194
river 17
for 486
a 6808
while 4
some 30
of 111
the 194
grounds 10
when 6
in 2720
where 21
the 194
opening 3
of 111
the 194
gave 4
the 194

Gardiner 3
a 6808
wish 13
of 111
going 3
round 29
the 194
whole 26
park 18
but 82
it 67
might 9
be 1205
a 6808
walk 25
With 34
a 6808
smile 7
they 5
were 5
that 11

the 194
general 22
air 129
of 111
the 194
scene 5
it 67
was 93
a 6808
spot 24
less 19

thought 11
of 111

the 194

as 509
as 509
possible 3
Her 182

the 194
opposite 4
side 74
of 111
the 194

in 2720
the 194
direction 5
but 82
progress 14
was 93
slow 17
for 486
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
though 12
able 3
to 805
indulge 8
the 194
taste 15
was 93
fond 17
of 111
and 51
was 93
so 797
in 2720
the 194
appearance 3
of 111
some 30
trout 3
in 2720
the 194
water 88
and 51
to 805
the 194
man 343
them 9
that 11
he 965
but 82
little 6
wandering 3
on 86
in 2720
this 6
slow 17
manner 8
they 5
were 5
and 51
was 93
equal 17
to 805
what 14
it 67
had 11
at 272
first 8
by 57
the 194
sight 17
of 111
Mr 5
them 9
and 51
at 272
no 896
great 12
distance 4
The 194
walk 25

here 31
less 19
than 22
on 86
the 194
other 6
side 74
them 9
to 805
see 70
him 9
they 5
met 181
Elizabeth 5
was 93
at 272
least 3
more 11
prepared 3
for 486
an 972
interview 11
than 22
and 51
to 805
appear 7
and 51
to 805
speak 12
with 34
if 8
he 965
intended 3
to 805
meet 9
them 9
For 486
a 6808
few 6
she 199
felt 5
that 11
he 965
would 5
strike 14
into 26
some 30
other 6
path 25
The 194
idea 21
while 4
a 6808
turning 3
in 2720
the 194
walk 25
him 9
view 18
the 194
turning 3
past 71
he 965
was 93
them 9
With 34
a 6808
glance 4
she 199
saw 24
that 11
he 965
had 11
none 32
of 111
his 43
recent 6
and 51
to 805
imitate 3
his 43
she 199
as 509
they 5
met 181
to 805
admire 6
the 194
of 111
the 194
place 29
but 82
she 199
had 11
not 85
got 14
the 194
words 5
and 51
when 6
some 30
and 51
she 199
that 11
praise 7
of 111
her 182
might 9
be 1205
Her 182
colour 3
and 51
she 199
no 896
more 11
Gardiner 3
was 93
standing 3
a 6808
little 6
behind 4
and 51
on 86
her 182
he 965
her 182
if 8
she 199
would 5
do 815
him 9
the 194
honour 4
of 111
him 9
to 805
her 182
friends 5
This 6
was 93
a 6808
stroke 4
of 111
for 486
she 199
was 93
unprepared 3
and 51
she 199
suppress 13
a 6808
smile 7
at 272
his 43
being 3
now 10
the 194
acquaintance 5
of 111
some 30
of 111
people 4
whom 3
his 43
pride 6
had 11
in 2720
his 43
offer 10
to 805
What 14
will 40
be 1205
his 43
surprise 4
thought 11
she 199
when 6
he 965
who 79
they 5
are 12
He 965
them 9
now 10
for 486
people 4
of 111
fashion 10
The 194
introduction 3
was 93
made 13
and 51
as 509
she 199
named 4
relationship 3
to 805
she 199
stole 4
a 6808
sly 4
look 14
at 272
him 9
to 805
see 70
how 27
he 965
bore 13
it 67
and 51
was 93
not 85
the 194
expectation 3
of 111
his 43
as 509
fast 29
as 509
he 965
disgraceful 4
companions 3
That 11
he 965
was 93
by 57
the 194
connection 3
was 93
he 965
it 67
with 34
and 51
so 797
far 91
going 3
back 182
with 34
them 9
and 51
into 26
conversation 8
with 34
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
Elizabeth 5
not 85
but 82
be 1205
not 85
but 82
triumph 10
It 67
was 93
that 11
he 965
should 7
know 12
she 199
had 11
some 30
relations 5
for 486
whom 3
there 21
was 93
no 896
need 29
to 805
blush 8
She 199
most 3
to 805
all 162
that 11
them 9
and 51
in 2720
every 10
expression 11
every 10
sentence 4
of 111
her 182
uncle 18
his 43
his 43
taste 15
or 333
his 43
good 28
The 194
conversation 8
soon 3
and 51
she 199
Mr 5
invite 7
him 9
with 34
the 194
to 805
fish 46
there 21
as 509
often 4
as 509
he 965
while 4
he 965
in 2720
the 194
offering 3
at 272
the 194
same 5
time 45
to 805
supply 3
him 9
with 34
tackle 7
and 51
out 365
of 111
the 194
stream 12
where 21
there 21
was 93
most 3
sport 36
Gardiner 3
who 79
was 93
arm 82
in 2720
arm 82
with 34
Elizabeth 5
gave 4
her 182
a 6808
look 14
expressive 4
of 111
wonder 17
Elizabeth 5
nothing 5
but 82
it 67
her 182
the 194
compliment 6
must 28
be 1205
all 162
for 486
Her 182
was 93
extreme 8
and 51
was 93
she 199
Why 4
is 124
he 965
so 797
what 14
can 288
it 67
proceed 7
It 67
be 1205
for 486
me 1043

be 1205
for 486
my 90
sake 3
that 11

My 90
at 272

a 6808
change 21
as 509
this 6
It 67
is 124
that 11
he 965
should 7
still 13
love 30
me 1043
After 48
some 30

there 21
to 805

a 6808
little 6
alteration 3
It 67
in 2720
Gardiner 3
who 79

After 48

She 199

assured 4
of 111
his 43

them 9
and 51
if 8
she 199
might 9
judge 7

his 43

was 93
not 85
There 21

also 3
one 19
other 6
person 33
in 2720
the 194
party 3

after 48
a 6808

you 30
Will 40

my 90
sister 10
to 805
your 4
acquaintance 5
your 4
stay 7
at 272
The 194
surprise 4
of 111
an 972
application 3
was 93
great 12
it 67
was 93
too 50
great 12
for 486
her 182
to 805
know 12
in 2720
what 14
manner 8
she 199
to 805

She 199
felt 5
that 11
desire 6
Miss 71
might 9
have 11
of 111
being 3
with 34
her 182
must 28
be 1205
the 194
work 87
of 111
her 182
brother 9
and 51
it 67
was 93
it 67
was 93
to 805
know 12
that 11
his 43
resentment 3
had 11
not 85
made 13
him 9
think 8
ill 84
of 111
her 182
They 5
now 10
on 86
in 2720
silence 7
of 111
them 9
deep 12
in 2720
thought 11
Elizabeth 5
was 93
not 85
comfortable 3
that 11
was 93
but 82
she 199
was 93
and 51
His 43
wish 13
of 111
his 43
sister 10
to 805
her 182
was 93
a 6808
compliment 6
of 111
the 194
kind 31
They 5
soon 3
the 194
and 51
when 6
they 5
had 11
the 194
carriage 5
Mr 5
and 51
Gardiner 3
were 5
half 23
a 6808
quarter 25
of 111
a 6808
mile 15
behind 4
He 965
then 5
her 182
to 805
walk 25
into 26
the 194
house 87
but 82
she 199
not 85
tired 6
and 51
they 5
together 3
on 86
the 194
lawn 6
At 272
a 6808
time 45
might 9
have 11
and 51
silence 7
was 93
awkward 6
She 199
to 805
talk 18
but 82
there 21
to 805
be 1205
an 972
embargo 5
on 86
every 10
subject 11
At 272
last 7
she 199
that 11
she 199
had 11
and 51
they 5
of 111
and 51
Dove 16
Dale 5
with 34
great 12
Yet 4
time 45
and 51
her 182
aunt 6
and 51
her 182
and 51
her 182
were 5
out 365
the 194
t 6038
te 887
t 6038
te 887
was 93
over 598
On 86
Mr 5
and 51
coming 3
up 194
they 5
were 5
all 162
to 805
go 500
into 26
the 194
house 87
and 51
take 18
some 30
refreshment 4
but 82
this 6
was 93
and 51
they 5
on 86
side 74
with 34
Mr 5
the 194
into 26
the 194
carriage 5
and 51
when 6
it 67
drove 6
off 102
Elizabeth 5
saw 24
him 9
the 194
house 87
The 194
of 111
her 182
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
now 10
and 51
of 111
them 9
him 9
to 805
be 1205
superior 5
to 805
anything 3
they 5
had 11
He 965
is 124
well 24
polite 8
and 51
her 182
uncle 18
There 21
is 124
something 3
a 6808
little 6
in 2720
him 9
to 805
be 1205
sure 11
her 182
aunt 6
but 82
it 67
is 124
to 805
his 43
air 129
and 51
is 124
not 85
I 4331
can 288
now 10
say 7
with 34
the 194
housekeeper 3
that 11
though 12
some 30
people 4
may 49
call 57
him 9
proud 5
I 4331
have 11
nothing 5
of 111
it 67
I 4331
was 93
never 3
more 11
than 22
by 57
his 43
to 805
us 70
It 67
was 93
more 11
than 22
civil 15
it 67
was 93
attentive 4
and 51
there 21
was 93
no 896
for 486
attention 3
His 43
acquaintance 5
with 34
Elizabeth 5
was 93
To 805
be 1205
sure 11
her 182
aunt 6
he 965
is 124
not 85
so 797
handsome 6
as 509
or 333
he 965
has 41
not 85
countenance 4
for 486
his 43
are 12
good 28
But 82
how 27
came 36
you 30
to 805
tell 16
me 1043
that 11
he 965
was 93
so 797
disagreeable 3
Elizabeth 5
as 509
well 24
as 509
she 199
that 11
she 199
had 11
him 9
better 7
when 6
they 5
had 11
met 181
in 2720
Kent 9
than 22
and 51
that 11
she 199
had 11
never 3
him 9
so 797
pleasant 9
as 509
this 6
morning 3
But 82
he 965
may 49
be 1205
a 6808
little 6
whimsical 4
in 2720
his 43
her 182
uncle 18
Your 4
great 12
men 140
often 4
are 12
and 51
I 4331
shall 12
not 85
take 18
him 9
at 272
his 43
word 26
as 509
he 965
might 9
change 21
his 43
mind 25
day 27
and 51
warn 8
me 1043
off 102
his 43
grounds 10
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
that 11
they 5
had 11
his 43
character 17
but 82
nothing 5
what 14
we 446
have 11
of 111
him 9
Gardiner 3
I 4331
should 7
not 85
have 11
thought 11
that 11
he 965
have 11
in 2720
so 797
cruel 9
a 6808
way 27
by 57
as 509
he 965
has 41
done 3
by 57
poor 11
He 965
has 41
not 85
an 972
ill 84

On 86
the 194
there 21
is 124
something 3
pleasing 3
his 43
mouth 22
when 6
he 965
And 51
there 21
is 124
something 3
of 111
in 2720
his 43
countenance 4
that 11
would 5
not 85
give 15
one 19
an 972
idea 21
of 111
his 43
heart 59
But 82
to 805
be 1205
sure 11
the 194
good 28
lady 18
who 79
us 70
his 43
house 87
did 23
give 15
him 9
a 6808
most 3
flaming 5
character 17
I 4331
help 23
laughing 6
But 82
he 965
is 124
a 6808
liberal 17
master 28
I 4331
suppose 4
and 51
that 11
in 2720
the 194
eye 57
of 111
a 6808
servant 3
every 10
virtue 3
Elizabeth 5
here 31
felt 5
on 86
to 805
say 7
something 3
in 2720
vindication 3
of 111
his 43
to 805
and 51
gave 4
them 9
to 805
understand 8
in 2720
as 509
a 6808
manner 8
as 509
she 199
that 11
by 57
what 14
she 199
had 11
his 43
relations 5
in 2720
Kent 9
his 43
were 5
of 111
a 6808
different 11
construction 7
and 51
that 11
his 43
character 17
was 93
by 57
no 896
so 797
nor 102
so 797
as 509
they 5
had 11
in 2720
In 2720
confirmation 3
of 111
this 6
she 199
related 3
the 194
of 111
all 162
the 194
in 2720
they 5
had 11
her 182
but 82
it 67
to 805
be 1205
as 509
might 9
be 1205
on 86
Gardiner 3
was 93
and 51
but 82
as 509
they 5
were 5
now 10
the 194
scene 5
of 111
her 182
former 3
every 10
idea 21
gave 4
way 27
to 805
the 194
charm 14
of 111
recollection 3
and 51
she 199
was 93
too 50
in 2720
out 365
to 805
her 182
husband 10
all 162
the 194
in 2720
to 805
think 8
of 111
anything 3
as 509
she 199
had 11
by 57
the 194
walk 25
they 5
had 11
no 896
than 22
she 199
set 40
off 102
in 2720
quest 21
of 111
her 182
former 3
acquaintance 5
and 51
the 194
evening 3
was 93
in 2720
the 194
of 111
an 972
after 48
discontinuance 3
The 194
of 111
the 194
day 27
were 5
too 50
full 16
of 111
interest 6
to 805
leave 14
Elizabeth 5
attention 3
for 486
any 17
of 111
these 4
new 115
friends 5
and 51
she 199
do 815
nothing 5
but 82
think 8
and 51
think 8
with 34
wonder 17
of 111
Mr 5
and 51
above 3
all 162
of 111
his 43
her 182
to 805
be 1205
with 34
his 43
sister 10
Chapter 3
Elizabeth 5
had 11
it 67
that 11
Mr 5
would 5
bring 6
his 43
sister 10
to 805
visit 14
her 182
the 194
day 27
after 48
her 182
and 51
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1205
out 365
of 111
sight 17
of 111
the 194
inn 59
the 194
whole 26
of 111
that 11
morning 3
But 82
her 182
conclusion 3
was 93
false 12
for 486
on 86
the 194
morning 3
after 48
arrival 3
at 272
these 4
came 36
They 5
had 11
the 194
place 29
with 34
some 30
of 111
new 115
friends 5
and 51
were 5
just 24
to 805
the 194
inn 59
to 805
dress 22
for 486
with 34
the 194
same 5
when 6
the 194
sound 29
of 111
a 6808
carriage 5
them 9
to 805
a 6808
window 12
and 51
they 5
saw 24
a 6808
gentleman 4
and 51
a 6808
lady 18
in 2720
a 6808
up 194
the 194
street 15
Elizabeth 5
the 194
livery 5
what 14
it 67
meant 3
and 51
no 896
small 14
degree 3
of 111
her 182
surprise 4
to 805
her 182
relations 5
by 57
them 9
with 34
the 194
honour 4
she 199
Her 182
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
were 5
all 162
and 51
the 194
embarrassment 3
of 111
her 182
manner 8
as 509
she 199
spoke 14
to 805
the 194
circumstance 4
and 51
of 111
the 194
of 111
the 194
day 27
to 805
them 9
a 6808
new 115
idea 21
on 86
the 194
business 13
Nothing 5
had 11
ever 33
it 67
but 82
they 5
felt 5
that 11
there 21
was 93
no 896
other 6
way 27
of 111
for 486
a 6808
quarter 25
than 22
by 57
a 6808
for 486
niece 3
While 4
these 4
newly 4
born 4
were 5
passing 3
in 2720
heads 25
the 194
perturbation 3
of 111
was 93
at 272
every 10
moment 15
She 199
was 93
at 272
her 182
own 9
but 82
other 6
of 111
disquiet 7
she 199
lest 5
the 194
of 111
the 194
brother 9
should 7
have 11
too 50
in 2720
her 182
favour 7
and 51
more 11
than 22
anxious 4
to 805
please 3
she 199
that 11
every 10
power 19
of 111
pleasing 3
would 5
fail 12
her 182
She 199
the 194
window 12
fearful 4
of 111
being 3
and 51
as 509
she 199
up 194
and 51
down 90
the 194
room 22
to 805
compose 7
saw 24
of 111
surprise 4
in 2720
her 182
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
as 509
made 13
worse 6
Miss 71
and 51
her 182
brother 9
and 51
this 6
introduction 3
place 29
With 34
did 23
Elizabeth 5
see 70
that 11
her 182
new 115
acquaintance 5
was 93
at 272
least 3
as 509
as 509
Since 7
her 182
being 3
at 272
she 199
had 11
that 11
Miss 71
was 93
proud 5
but 82
the 194
observation 4
of 111
a 6808
few 6
minutes 3
her 182
that 11
she 199
was 93
shy 14
She 199
found 18
it 67
difficult 5
to 805
obtain 7
even 36
a 6808
word 26
her 182
a 6808
monosyllable 3
Miss 71
was 93
tall 35
and 51
on 86
a 6808
scale 6
than 22
Elizabeth 5
and 51
though 12
little 6
more 11
than 22
sixteen 6
her 182
figure 7
was 93
and 51
her 182
appearance 3
and 51
graceful 4
She 199
was 93
less 19
handsome 6
than 22
her 182
brother 9
but 82
there 21
was 93
sense 8
and 51
good 28
in 2720
her 182
face 19
and 51
her 182
were 5
and 51
gentle 20
Elizabeth 5
who 79
had 11
to 805
find 10
in 2720
her 182
as 509
acute 8
and 51
an 972
observer 3
as 509
ever 33
Mr 5
had 11

by 57

They 5
had 11
not 85
long 50
together 3
Mr 5
her 182
that 11
Bingley 4
was 93
also 3
coming 3
to 805
wait 19
on 86
her 182
and 51
she 199
had 11
time 45
to 805
express 25
her 182
satisfaction 3
and 51
prepare 5
for 486
a 6808
visitor 3
when 6
quick 25
step 48
was 93
on 86
the 194

in 2720
a 6808
moment 15
he 965

room 22
All 162
anger 5
him 9
had 11
long 50
done 3
but 82
had 11
she 199
still 13
felt 5
any 17

ground 36
the 194

on 86
her 182
He 965
in 2720
a 6808
though 12
general 22
way 27
after 48
her 182
and 51
and 51
spoke 14
with 34
the 194
same 5
good 28
ease 10
that 11
he 965
had 11
ever 33
done 3
To 805
Mr 5
and 51
Gardiner 3
he 965
was 93
a 6808
less 19
personage 3
than 22
to 805
They 5
had 11
long 50
to 805
see 70
him 9
The 194
whole 26
party 3

a 6808
attention 3
The 194
had 11
just 24
of 111
Mr 5
and 51

observation 4
with 34
an 972
earnest 8
though 12
and 51
they 5
soon 3
the 194
full 16
conviction 3
that 11
one 19
of 111
them 9
at 272
least 3
what 14
it 67
was 93
to 805
love 30
Of 111
the 194
they 5
a 6808
little 6
in 2720
doubt 15
but 82
that 11
the 194
gentleman 4
was 93

She 199

the 194
latter 3
object 26
where 21
she 199
most 3
to 805
fail 12
she 199
was 93
most 3
sure 11
of 111
success 13
for 486

In 2720
Bingley 4
her 182
to 805
her 182
sister 10
and 51
oh 17
how 27
did 23
she 199
long 50
to 805
know 12
any 17
of 111
his 43

in 2720
a 6808
like 22
manner 8
she 199

that 11
he 965
less 19
than 22
on 86
former 3
and 51
or 333
with 34
the 194
notion 5
that 11
as 509
he 965
at 272
her 182
he 965
was 93
to 805
trace 13
a 6808
resemblance 3
But 82
though 12
this 6
might 9
be 1205
she 199
not 85
be 1205
as 509
to 805
his 43

Miss 71
who 79

On 86

interpretation 3
a 6808
recollection 3
of 111
Jane 9
not 85

a 6808
wish 13
of 111
saying 3
more 11
that 11
might 9
lead 15

at 272
a 6808
moment 15
when 6
the 194
were 5
together 3
and 51
in 2720
a 6808
tone 12
had 11
something 3
of 111
real 48
regret 9
that 11
it 67
was 93
a 6808
long 50
time 45
since 7
he 965

had 11
the 194
pleasure 5

It 67

We 446

of 111
November 3
when 6
we 446
were 5
all 162
together 3
at 272
Elizabeth 5
was 93
to 805
find 10
his 43

exact 14
and 51
he 965
occasion 7
to 805
ask 6
her 182
when 6
to 805
by 57
any 17
of 111
the 194
rest 110
all 162

There 21
was 93
not 85

in 2720
the 194
remark 9
but 82
there 21
was 93
a 6808
look 14
and 51
a 6808
manner 8
gave 4
them 9
meaning 11
It 67
was 93
not 85
often 4
that 11
she 199

her 182
eyes 8
on 86
Mr 5
but 82
she 199
did 23
catch 24
a 6808
glimpse 4
she 199
saw 24
an 972
expression 11
of 111
general 22
and 51
in 2720
all 162
that 11
he 965

her 182
that 11
the 194
improvement 3
of 111
she 199
had 11
yesterday 3

might 9
prove 21

one 19
day 27
When 6
she 199
saw 24
him 9
the 194

good 28
opinion 4
of 111
people 4
with 34
whom 3
any 17
a 6808
few 6
ago 15
would 5
have 11
a 6808
disgrace 8
when 6
she 199
saw 24
him 9
civil 15
not 85
to 805
but 82
to 805
the 194
relations 5

he 965
had 11
and 51
last 7
scene 5
in 2720
Parsonage 3
the 194
difference 3
the 194
change 21
was 93
so 797
great 12

mind 25
that 11
she 199

Never 3
even 36

so 797

was 93
in 2720
her 182
and 51
the 194
with 34
him 9
gave 4
her 182
a 6809
distress 7
but 82
to 805
repel 7
the 194
ill 84
attack 8
she 199
the 194
question 16
in 2720
a 6809
tone 12
While 4
she 199
spoke 14
an 973
glance 4
her 182
with 34
a 6809
complexion 5
at 272
her 182
and 51
his 43
sister 10
with 34
confusion 3
and 51
to 805
lift 11
up 194
her 182
eyes 8
Had 11
Miss 71
Bingley 4
what 14
pain 42
she 199
was 93
then 5
her 182
beloved 3
friend 15
she 199
would 5
have 11
the 194
hint 13
but 82
she 199
had 11
intended 3
to 805
discompose 3
Elizabeth 5
by 57
forward 12
the 194
idea 21
of 111
a 6809
man 343
to 805
whom 3
she 199
her 182
partial 6
to 805
make 17
her 182
betray 10
a 6809
might 9
injure 6
her 182
in 2720
opinion 4
and 51
to 805
remind 7
the 194
latter 3
of 111
all 162
the 194
and 51
by 57
some 30
part 102
of 111
her 182
were 5
with 34
that 11
corps 8
Not 85
a 6809
syllable 3
had 11
ever 33
her 182
of 111
Miss 71
elopement 3
To 805
no 896
creature 3
had 11
it 67
where 21
was 93
possible 3
except 10
to 805
Elizabeth 5
and 51
all 162
her 182
brother 9
was 93
anxious 4
to 805
conceal 10
it 67
the 194
wish 13
Elizabeth 5
had 11
long 50
ago 15
to 805
him 9
of 111
hereafter 3
her 182
own 9
He 965
had 11
a 6809
plan 61
and 51
meaning 11
that 11
it 67
should 7
affect 15
his 43
endeavour 4
to 805
separate 7
him 9
Miss 71
Bennet 4
it 67
is 124
probable 3
that 11
it 67
might 9
add 54
something 3
to 805
his 43
concern 6
for 486
the 194
of 111
his 43
friend 15
soon 3
his 43
emotion 12
and 51
as 509
Miss 71
Bingley 4
and 51
dared 6
not 85
approach 6
to 805
also 3
in 2720
time 45
though 12
not 85
to 805
be 1205
able 3
to 805
speak 12
any 17
more 11
Her 182
brother 9
eye 57

to 805
meet 9
her 182
interest 6
in 2720
the 194
affair 3
and 51
the 194
circumstance 4
had 11
to 805
turn 46
his 43
Elizabeth 5
to 805
have 11
them 9
on 86
her 182
more 11
and 51
more 11
visit 14
did 23
not 85
continue 3
long 50
after 48
the 194
question 16
and 51
answer 8
above 3
and 51
while 4
Mr 5
was 93
them 9
to 805
carriage 5
Miss 71
Bingley 4
was 93
her 182
in 2720
on 86
person 33
and 51
dress 22
But 82
would 5
not 85
join 16
her 182
Her 182
recommendation 3
was 93
to 805
ensure 6
her 182
favour 7
his 43
not 85
err 22
And 51
he 965
had 11
in 2720
of 111
Elizabeth 5
as 509
to 805
leave 14
the 194
power 19
of 111
finding 4
her 182
than 22
and 51
When 6
to 805
the 194
saloon 3
Miss 71
Bingley 4
not 85
help 23
to 805
him 9
some 30
part 102
of 111
what 14
she 199
had 11
saying 3
to 805
his 43
sister 10
How 27
ill 84
Miss 71
Eliza 7
Bennet 4
this 6
morning 3
Mr 5
she 199
I 4331
never 3
in 2720
my 90
life 44
saw 24
so 797
as 509
she 199
is 124
since 7
the 194
winter 13
She 199
is 124
grown 4
so 797
brown 25
and 51
coarse 10
and 51
I 4331
were 5
that 11
we 446
should 7
not 85
have 11
her 182
little 6
Mr 5
might 9
have 11
an 973
address 9
he 965
contented 4
with 34
that 11
he 965
no 896
other 6
alteration 3
than 22
her 182
being 3
no 896
consequence 3
of 111
in 2720
the 194
summer 13
For 486
my 90
own 9
part 102
she 199
I 4331
must 28
confess 14
that 11
I 4331
never 3
see 70
any 17
in 2720
her 182
Her 182
face 19
is 124
too 50
thin 35
her 182
complexion 5
has 41
no 896
and 51
her 182
are 12
not 85
at 272
all 162
handsome 6
Her 182
nose 20
character 17
there 21
is 124
nothing 5
in 2720
lines 4
Her 182
teeth 6
are 12
but 82
not 85
out 365
of 111
the 194
common 23
way 27
and 51
as 509
for 486
her 182
eyes 8
have 11
so 797
fine 17
I 4331
never 3
see 70
anything 3
in 2720
them 9
They 5
have 11
a 6809
sharp 30
look 14
I 4331
do 815
not 85
like 22
at 272
all 162
and 51
in 2720
her 182
air 129
there 21
is 124
a 6809
self 11
fashion 10
is 124
as 509
Miss 71
Bingley 4
was 93
that 11
Elizabeth 5
this 6
was 93
not 85
the 194
best 37
method 18
of 111
but 82
people 4
are 12
not 85
wise 17
and 51
in 2720
him 9
at 272
last 7
look 14
she 199
had 11
all 162
the 194
success 13
she 199
He 965
was 93
silent 6
and 51
a 6809
determination 3
of 111
making 4
him 9
speak 12
she 199
I 4331
remember 4
when 6
we 446
first 8
her 182
in 2720
how 27
we 446
all 162
were 5
to 805
find 10
that 11
she 199
was 93
a 6809
and 51
I 4331
recollect 7
your 4
saying 3
one 19
night 61
after 48
they 5
had 11
at 272
' 10
She 199
a 6809
I 4331
should 7
as 509
soon 3
call 57
her 182
mother 21
a 6809
wit 77
' 10
But 82
she 199
to 805
improve 6
on 86
you 30
and 51
I 4331
believe 6
you 30
thought 11
her 182
pretty 3
at 272
one 19
time 45
Yes 16
who 79
contain 16
no 896
but 82
that 11
was 93
when 6
I 4331
first 8
saw 24
her 182
for 486
it 67
is 124
since 7
I 4331
have 11
her 182
as 509
one 19
of 111
the 194
women 6
of 111
my 90
acquaintance 5
He 965
then 5
and 51
Miss 71
Bingley 4
was 93
left 19
to 805
all 162
the 194
satisfaction 3
of 111
him 9
to 805
say 7
what 14
gave 4
no 896
one 19
any 17
pain 42
but 82
Gardiner 3
and 51
Elizabeth 5
of 111
all 162
that 11
had 11
visit 14
as 509
they 5
except 10
what 14
had 11
them 9
both 8
The 194
look 14
and 51
of 111
they 5
had 11
were 5
except 10
of 111
the 194
person 33
who 79
had 11
attention 3
They 5
of 111
his 43
sister 10
his 43
friends 5
his 43
house 87
his 43
fruit 25
of 111
but 82
yet 4
Elizabeth 5
was 93
longing 4
to 805
know 12
what 14
Gardiner 3
thought 11
of 111
him 9
and 51
Gardiner 3
would 5
have 11
by 57
her 182
beginning 3
the 194
subject 11
Chapter 3
Elizabeth 5
had 11
a 6809
good 28
deal 13
in 2720
not 85
finding 4
a 6809
letter 20
Jane 9
on 86
first 8
arrival 3
at 272
and 51
this 6
disappointment 3
had 11
on 86
of 111
the 194
that 11
had 11
now 10
there 21
but 82
on 86
the 194
third 4
her 182
was 93
over 598
and 51
her 182
sister 10
by 57
the 194
receipt 5
of 111
two 14
her 182
at 272
on 86
one 19
of 111
was 93
that 11
it 67
had 11
Elizabeth 5
was 93
not 85
at 272
it 67
as 509
Jane 9
had 11
the 194
direction 5
ill 84
They 5
had 11
just 24
to 805
walk 25
as 509
the 194
came 36
in 2720
and 51
her 182
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
leaving 3
her 182
to 805
enjoy 9
them 9
in 2720
quiet 20
set 40
off 102
by 57
The 194
one 19
must 28
first 8
be 1205
to 805
it 67
had 11
five 5
ago 15
The 194
beginning 3
an 973
account 14
of 111
all 162
little 6
and 51
with 34
news 71
as 509
the 194
country 12
but 82
the 194
latter 3
half 23
was 93
a 6809
day 27
later 9
and 51
in 2720
agitation 3
gave 4
more 11
It 67
was 93
to 805
this 6
effect 15
Since 7
writing 3
the 194
above 3
something 3
has 41
of 111
a 6809
most 3
unexpected 4
and 51
serious 4
nature 5
but 82
I 4331
am 394
of 111
you 30
be 1205
assured 4
that 11
we 446
are 12
all 162
well 24
What 14
I 4331
have 11
to 805
say 7
to 805
poor 11
Lydia 5
An 973
express 25
came 36
at 272
twelve 6
last 7
night 61
just 24
as 509
we 446
were 5
all 162
gone 4
to 805
bed 93
Colonel 5
to 805
inform 21
us 70
that 11
she 199
was 93
gone 4
off 102
to 805
with 34
one 19
of 111
his 43
to 805
own 9
the 194
truth 7
with 34
Imagine 3
our 3
surprise 4
To 805
it 67
does 5
not 85
seem 10
so 797
unexpected 4
I 4331
am 394
So 797
a 6809
match 25
on 86
both 8
sides 23
But 82
I 4331
am 394
willing 4
to 805
hope 16
the 194
best 37
and 51
that 11
his 43
character 17
has 41
Thoughtless 4
and 51
I 4331
can 288
believe 6
him 9
but 82
this 6
step 48
and 51
let 50
us 70
rejoice 3
over 598
it 67
marks 6
nothing 5
bad 33
at 272
heart 59
His 43
choice 5
is 124
disinterested 4
at 272
least 3
for 486
he 965
must 28
know 12
my 90
father 12
can 288
give 15
her 182
nothing 5
Our 3
poor 11
mother 21
is 124
My 90
father 12
bears 4
it 67
better 7
How 27
thankful 4
am 394
I 4331
that 11
we 446
never 3
let 50
them 9
know 12
what 14
has 41
him 9
we 446
must 28
forget 8
it 67
They 5
were 5
off 102
Saturday 3
night 61
twelve 6
as 509
is 124
but 82
were 5
not 85
till 14
yesterday 3
morning 3
at 272
eight 18
The 194
express 25
was 93
sent 35
off 102
My 90
dear 15
they 5
must 28
have 11
within 3
ten 151
miles 4
of 111
us 70
Colonel 5
us 70
reason 13
to 805
expect 20
him 9
here 31
soon 3
Lydia 5
left 19
a 6809
few 6
lines 4
for 486
his 43
wife 6
her 182
of 111
intention 5
I 4331
must 28
conclude 3
for 486
I 4331
be 1205
long 50
my 90
poor 11
mother 21
I 4331
am 394
you 30
will 40
not 85
be 1205
able 3
to 805
make 17
it 67
out 365
but 82
I 4331
know 12
what 14
I 4331
have 11
time 45
for 486
consideration 3
and 51
knowing 3
what 14
she 199
felt 5
Elizabeth 5
on 86
this 6
letter 20
the 194
other 6
and 51
opening 3
it 67
with 34
the 194
impatience 3
read 49
as 509
it 67
had 11
a 6809
day 27
later 9
than 22
the 194
conclusion 3
of 111
the 194
first 8
By 57
this 6
time 45
my 90
sister 10
you 30
have 11
my 90
letter 20
I 4331
wish 13
this 6
may 49
be 1205
more 11
but 82
though 12
not 85
for 486
time 45
my 90
head 140
is 124
so 797
that 11
I 4331
answer 8
for 486
being 3
I 4331
know 12
what 14
I 4331
would 5
write 5
but 82
I 4331
have 11
bad 33
news 71
for 486
you 30
and 51
it 67
be 1205
as 509
the 194
marriage 6
Mr 5
and 51
our 3
poor 11
Lydia 5
would 5
be 1205
we 446
are 12
now 10
anxious 4
to 805
be 1205
assured 4
it 67
has 41
place 29
for 486
there 21
is 124
but 82
too 50
reason 13
to 805
fear 14
they 5
are 12
not 85
gone 4
to 805
Colonel 5
came 36
yesterday 3
left 19
the 194
day 27
not 85
after 48
the 194
express 25
Though 12
short 62
letter 20
to 805
F 4844
gave 4
them 9
to 805
understand 8
that 11
they 5
were 5
going 3
to 805
Green 57
something 3
was 93
by 57
his 43
belief 3
that 11
W 3180
never 3
intended 3
to 805
go 500
there 21
or 333
to 805
Lydia 5
at 272
all 162
was 93
to 805
Colonel 5
F 4844
who 79
taking 4
the 194
alarm 9
set 40
off 102
B 7217
to 805
trace 13
route 8
He 965
did 23
trace 13
them 9
to 805
but 82
no 896
further 8
for 486
on 86
that 11
place 29
they 5
into 26
a 6809
hackney 5
coach 11
and 51
the 194
chaise 3
that 11
them 9
All 162
that 11
is 124
after 48
this 6
is 124
that 11
they 5
were 5
to 805
continue 3
the 194
London 5
road 38
I 4331
know 12
not 85
what 14
to 805
think 8
After 48
making 4
every 10
possible 3
on 86
that 11
side 74
London 5
Colonel 5
F 4844
came 36
on 86
into 26
them 9
at 272
all 162
the 194
and 51
at 272
the 194
in 2720
Barnet 3
and 51
but 82
any 17
success 13
no 896
people 4
had 11
to 805
pass 66
through 4
With 34
the 194
concern 6
he 965
came 36
on 86
to 805
and 51
broke 15
his 43
to 805
us 70
in 2720
a 6809
manner 8
most 3
to 805
his 43
heart 59
I 4331
am 394
for 486
him 9
and 51
F 4844
but 82
no 896
one 19
can 288
throw 14
any 17
blame 13
on 86
them 9
Our 3
distress 7
my 90
dear 15
is 124
great 12
My 90
father 12
and 51
mother 21
believe 6
the 194
worst 6
but 82
I 4331
think 8
so 797
ill 84
of 111
him 9
might 9

And 51

I 4331

him 9
losing 3
a 6809
moment 15
of 111
the 194

so 797
precious 4
but 82
as 509
she 199
the 194
door 41

was 93
by 57
a 6809
servant 3
and 51
Mr 5
Her 182
pale 41
face 19
and 51
impetuous 4
manner 8
made 13
him 9
start 13
and 51
he 965
recover 8
to 805
speak 12
she 199
in 2720
mind 25
every 10
idea 21
was 93
by 57
situation 3
I 4331
beg 59
your 4
pardon 10
but 82
I 4331
must 28
leave 14
you 30
I 4331
must 28
find 10
Mr 5

moment 15
on 86
business 13

Good 28

more 11
feeling 4
than 22
then 5
I 4331
will 40
not 85

Mr 5

You 30

Elizabeth 5
but 82
her 182
under 288
her 182
and 51
she 199
felt 5
how 27
little 6
would 5
be 1205
by 57
her 182
to 805
pursue 6
them 9
Calling 3
back 182
the 194
servant 3
she 199
him 9
though 12
in 2720
so 797
breathless 4
an 973
accent 14
as 509
made 13
her 182
to 805
fetch 8
his 43
master 28
and 51
mistress 3
home 90
On 86
his 43
the 194
room 22
she 199
sat 92
down 90
to 805
support 10
and 51
so 797
ill 84
that 11
it 67
was 93
for 486
to 805
leave 14
her 182
or 333
to 805
refrain 5
saying 3
in 2720
a 6809
tone 12
of 111
and 51
commiseration 3
Let 50
me 1043
call 57
your 4
maid 19
Is 124
there 21
nothing 5
you 30
take 18
to 805
give 15
you 30
present 20
relief 3
A 6809
glass 23
of 111
wine 18
shall 12
I 4331
get 13
you 30
one 19
You 30
are 12
ill 84
No 896
I 4331
thank 15
you 30
she 199
to 805
recover 8
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
the 194
matter 7
with 34
me 1043
I 4331
am 394
well 24
I 4331
am 394
by 57
some 30
dreadful 4
news 71
I 4331
have 11
just 24
She 199
burst 4
into 26
as 509
she 199
to 805
it 67
and 51
for 486
a 6809
few 6
minutes 3
not 85
speak 12
word 26
in 2720
wretched 6
suspense 3
say 7
something 3
of 111
his 43
concern 6
and 51
observe 6
her 182
in 2720
silence 7
At 272
length 14
she 199
spoke 14
I 4331
have 11
just 24
had 11
a 6809
letter 20
Jane 9
with 34
dreadful 4
news 71
It 67
be 1205
My 90
sister 10
has 41
left 19
all 162
her 182
friends 5
has 41
has 41
into 26
the 194
power 19
of 111
of 111
Mr 5
They 5
are 12
gone 4
off 102
together 3
You 30
know 12
him 9
too 50
well 24
to 805
doubt 15
the 194
rest 110
She 199
has 41
no 896
money 17
no 896
nothing 5
that 11
can 288
tempt 14
him 9
to 805
she 199
is 124
for 486
ever 33
was 93
in 2720
When 6
I 4331
consider 13
she 199
in 2720
a 6809
yet 4
more 11
voice 8
that 11
I 4331
might 9
have 11
it 67
I 4331
who 79
what 14
he 965
was 93
Had 11
I 4331
but 82
some 30
part 102
of 111
it 67
some 30
part 102
of 111
what 14
I 4331
to 805
my 90
own 9
Had 11
his 43
character 17
this 6
not 85
have 11
But 82
it 67
is 124
all 162
all 162
too 50
late 23
now 10
I 4331
am 394
But 82
is 124
it 67
certain 5
certain 5
Oh 17
yes 16
They 5
left 19
together 3
on 86
Sunday 3
night 61
and 51
were 5
to 805
London 5
but 82
not 85
they 5
are 12
not 85
gone 4
to 805
And 51
what 14
has 41
done 3
what 14
has 41
to 805
recover 8
her 182
My 90
father 12
is 124
gone 4
to 805
London 5
and 51
Jane 9
has 41
to 805
beg 59
my 90
immediate 4
and 51
we 446
shall 12
be 1205
off 102
I 4331
hope 16
in 2720
half 23
an 973
hour 10
But 82
nothing 5
can 288
be 1205
done 3
I 4331
know 12
well 24
that 11
nothing 5
can 288
be 1205
done 3
How 27
is 124
a 6809
man 343
to 805
be 1205
on 86
How 27
are 12
they 5
even 36
to 805
be 1205
I 4331
have 11
not 85
the 194
hope 16
It 67
is 124
every 10
way 27
horrible 3
his 43
head 140
in 2720
silent 6
When 6
my 90
eyes 8
were 5
to 805
his 43
real 48
character 17
Oh 17
had 11
I 4331
what 14
I 4331
what 14
I 4331
dared 6
to 805
do 815
But 82
I 4331
not 85
I 4331
was 93
of 111
doing 3
too 50
Wretched 6
wretched 6
mistake 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
He 965
to 805
hear 78
her 182
and 51
was 93
up 194
and 51
down 90
the 194
room 22
in 2720
earnest 8
meditation 3
his 43
brow 40
his 43
air 129
Elizabeth 5
soon 3
and 51
it 67
Her 182
power 19
was 93
must 28
sink 13
under 288
a 6809
proof 11
of 111
weakness 3
an 973
assurance 3
of 111
the 194
disgrace 8
She 199
wonder 17
nor 102
condemn 11
but 82
the 194
belief 3
of 111
his 43
self 11
conquest 3
nothing 5
to 805
her 182
bosom 4
no 896
of 111
her 182
distress 7
It 67
was 93
on 86
the 194
to 805
make 17
her 182
understand 8
her 182
own 9
and 51
never 3
had 11
she 199
so 797
felt 5
that 11
she 199
have 11
him 9
as 509
now 10
when 6
all 162
love 30
must 28
be 1205
vain 8
But 82
self 11
though 12
it 67
would 5
intrude 6
not 85
engross 6
her 182
Lydia 5
the 194
humiliation 3
the 194
she 199
was 93
on 86
them 9
all 162
soon 3
up 194
every 10
private 9
care 47
and 51
covering 3
her 182
face 19
with 34
her 182
handkerchief 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
soon 3
to 805
and 51
after 48
a 6809
pause 4
of 111
several 3
minutes 3
was 93
to 805
a 6809
sense 8
of 111
her 182
situation 3
by 57
the 194
voice 8
of 111
her 182
companion 10
who 79
in 2720
a 6809
manner 8
though 12
it 67
spoke 14
compassion 4
spoke 14
restraint 3
I 4331
am 394
you 30
have 11
long 50
my 90
absence 3
nor 102
have 11
I 4331
anything 3
to 805
plead 10
in 2720
excuse 4
of 111
my 90
stay 7
but 82
real 48
though 12
concern 6
Would 5
to 805
Heaven 9
that 11
anything 3
be 1205
or 333
done 3
on 86
my 90
part 102
that 11
might 9
offer 10
consolation 3
to 805
distress 7
But 82
I 4331
will 40
not 85
torment 9
you 30
with 34
vain 8
may 49
seem 10
to 805
ask 6
for 486
your 4
thanks 4
This 6
unfortunate 4
affair 3
will 40
I 4331
fear 14
prevent 13
my 90
the 194
pleasure 5
of 111
you 30
at 272
to 805
day 27
Oh 17
yes 16
Be 1205
so 797
kind 31
as 509
to 805
for 486
us 70
to 805
Miss 72
Say 7
that 11
business 13
us 70
home 90
Conceal 10
the 194
truth 7
as 509
long 50
as 509
it 67
is 124
possible 3
I 4331
know 12
it 67
be 1205
long 50
He 965
assured 4
her 182
of 111
his 43
his 43
sorrow 9
for 486
her 182
distress 7
it 67
a 6809
conclusion 3
than 22
there 21
was 93
at 272
present 20
reason 13
to 805
hope 16
and 51
leaving 3
his 43
for 486
her 182
relations 5
with 34
one 19
serious 4
parting 3
look 14
As 509
he 965
the 194
room 22
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
how 27
it 67
was 93
that 11
they 5
should 7
ever 33
see 70
other 6
on 86
of 111
as 509
had 11
several 3
in 2720
and 51
as 509
she 199
a 6809
retrospective 4
glance 4
over 598
the 194
whole 26
of 111
acquaintance 5
so 797
full 16
of 111
and 51
at 272
the 194
of 111
would 5
now 10
have 11
continuance 3
and 51
would 5
have 11
in 2720
termination 3
If 8
and 51
esteem 5
are 12
good 28
of 111
affection 5
change 21
of 111
sentiment 18
will 40
be 1205
nor 102
But 82
if 8
if 8
regard 7
is 124
unreasonable 3
or 333
unnatural 4
in 2720
comparison 3
of 111
what 14
is 124
so 797
often 4
as 509
on 86
a 6809
first 8
interview 11
with 34
object 26
and 51
even 36
two 14
words 5
have 11
nothing 5
can 288
be 1205
in 2720
her 182
except 10
that 11
she 199
had 11
given 3
of 111
a 6809
trial 5
to 805
the 194
latter 3
method 18
in 2720
her 182
for 486
and 51
that 11
ill 84
success 13
might 9
her 182
to 805
seek 6
the 194
other 6
less 19
mode 57
of 111
attachment 3
Be 1205
that 11
as 509
it 67
may 49
she 199
saw 24
him 9
go 500
with 34
regret 9
and 51
in 2720
this 6
example 4
of 111
what 14
must 28
produce 7
found 18
anguish 5
as 509
she 199
on 86
that 11
wretched 6
business 13
Never 3
since 7
reading 3
second 16
letter 20
had 11
she 199
a 6810
hope 16
of 111
meaning 11
to 805
her 182
No 896
one 19
but 82
Jane 9
she 199
thought 11
flatter 10
with 34
an 973
expectation 3
Surprise 4
was 93
the 194
least 3
of 111
her 182
on 86
this 6
development 5
While 4
the 194
of 111
the 194
first 8
letter 20
in 2720
her 182
mind 25
she 199
was 93
all 162
surprise 4
all 162
that 11
should 7
a 6810
girl 14
whom 3
it 67
was 93
he 965
for 486
money 17
and 51
how 27
Lydia 5
ever 33
have 11
him 9
had 11
But 82
now 10
it 67
was 93
all 162
too 50
natural 18
For 486
an 973
attachment 3
as 509
this 6
she 199
might 9
have 11
and 51
though 12
she 199
did 23
not 85
suppose 4
Lydia 5
to 805
be 1205
in 2720
an 973
elopement 3
the 194
intention 5
of 111
marriage 6
she 199
had 11
no 896
in 2720

her 182

She 199
had 11
never 3
while 4
the 194
regiment 9
was 93
in 2720
that 11
Lydia 5
had 11

to 805
one 19
officer 4

her 182

in 2720
her 182
opinion 4
Her 182

but 82
never 3
an 973

The 194
of 111
neglect 9
and 51
indulgence 3
a 6810
girl 14
oh 17
how 27
did 23
she 199
now 10
feel 11
it 67
She 199
was 93
wild 36
to 805
be 1205
at 272
home 90
to 805
hear 78
to 805

the 194

with 34
Jane 9
in 2720
the 194
cares 6
that 11
must 28
now 10
fall 29
her 182
in 2720
a 6810
so 797
a 6810
father 12
absent 14
a 6810

Though 12
Lydia 5

never 3

Mr 5
and 51
Gardiner 3
not 85
but 82

Not 85
Lydia 5
but 82
all 162
were 5
in 2720
it 67
and 51
after 48
the 194
first 8
of 111
surprise 4
and 51
horror 3
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
every 10
in 2720
his 43
power 19
Elizabeth 5
though 12
no 896
less 19
him 9
with 34
of 111
and 51
all 162
three 12
being 3
by 57
one 19
spirit 20
to 805
journey 11
was 93
They 5
were 5
to 805
be 1205
off 102
as 509
soon 3
as 509
possible 3
But 82
what 14
is 124
to 805
be 1205
done 3
Gardiner 3
John 20
us 70
Mr 5
was 93
here 31
when 6
you 30
sent 35
for 486
us 70
was 93
it 67
so 797
Yes 16
and 51
I 4331
him 9
we 446
should 7
not 85
be 1205
able 3
to 805
keep 11
our 3
engagement 3
That 11
is 124
all 162
What 14
is 124
all 162
the 194
other 6
as 509
she 199
ran 110
into 26
her 182
room 22
to 805
prepare 5
And 51
are 12
they 5
as 509
for 486
her 182
to 805
disclose 3
the 194
real 48
truth 7
Oh 17
that 11
I 4331
how 27
it 67
was 93
But 82
were 5
vain 8
or 333
at 272
least 3
serve 9
to 805
amuse 6
her 182
in 2720
the 194
hurry 3
and 51
confusion 3
of 111
the 194
following 3
hour 10
Had 11
Elizabeth 5
at 272
leisure 8
to 805
be 1205
idle 10
she 199
would 5
have 11
certain 5
that 11
all 162
employment 3
was 93
to 805
one 19
so 797
wretched 6
as 509
but 82
she 199
had 11
her 182
share 22
of 111
business 13
as 509
well 24
as 509
her 182
aunt 6
and 51
the 194
rest 110
there 21
were 5
to 805
be 1205
to 805
all 162
friends 5
at 272
with 34
false 12
for 486
sudden 4
departure 3
An 973
hour 10
saw 24
the 194
whole 26
and 51
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
his 43
account 14
at 272
the 194
inn 59
nothing 5
to 805
be 1205
done 3
but 82
to 805
go 500
and 51
Elizabeth 5
after 48
all 162
the 194
of 111
the 194
morning 3
found 18
in 2720
a 6810
space 34
of 111
time 45
than 22
she 199
have 11
in 2720
the 194
carriage 5
and 51
on 86
the 194
road 38
to 805
Chapter 3
I 4331
have 11
it 67
over 598
Elizabeth 5
her 182
uncle 18
as 509
they 5
drove 6
the 194
town 27
and 51
serious 4
consideration 3
I 4331
am 394
more 11
than 22
I 4331
was 93
to 805
judge 7
as 509
your 4
sister 10
does 5
on 86
the 194
matter 7
It 67
to 805
me 1043
so 797
that 11
any 17
young 10
man 343
should 7
form 68
a 6810
design 17
a 6810
girl 14
who 79
is 124
by 57
no 896
or 333
and 51
who 79
was 93
in 2720
his 43
that 11
I 4331
am 394
to 805
hope 16
the 194
best 37
he 965
expect 20
that 11
her 182
friends 5
would 5
not 85
step 48
forward 12
he 965
expect 20
to 805
be 1205
by 57
the 194
regiment 9
after 48
an 973
affront 5
to 805
Colonel 5
His 43
temptation 3
is 124
not 85
adequate 4
to 805
the 194
risk 11
Do 815
you 30
think 8
so 797
Elizabeth 5
up 194
for 486
a 6810
moment 15
my 90
word 26
Gardiner 3
I 4331
begin 8
to 805
be 1205
of 111
your 4
opinion 4
It 67
is 124
too 50
great 12
a 6810
violation 3
of 111
honour 4
and 51
interest 6
for 486
him 9
to 805
be 1205
of 111
I 4331
think 8
so 797
ill 84
of 111
Can 288
you 30
so 797
give 15
him 9
up 194
as 509
to 805
believe 6
him 9
of 111
it 67
Not 85
of 111
his 43
own 9
interest 6
but 82
of 111
every 10
other 6
neglect 9
I 4331
can 288
believe 6
him 9
If 8
it 67
should 7
be 1205
so 797
But 82
I 4331
dare 15
not 85
hope 16
it 67
Why 4
should 7
they 5
not 85
go 500
on 86
to 805
if 8
that 11
had 11
the 194
case 25
In 2720
the 194
first 8
place 29
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
there 21
is 124
no 896
absolute 7
proof 11
that 11
they 5
are 12
not 85
gone 4
to 805
Oh 17
but 82
the 194
chaise 3
into 26
a 6810
hackney 5
coach 11
is 124
a 6810
presumption 3
And 51
no 896
of 111
them 9
were 5
to 805
be 1205
found 18
on 86
the 194
Barnet 3
road 38
Well 24
then 5
them 9
to 805
be 1205
in 2720
London 5
They 5
may 49
be 1205
there 21
though 12
for 486
the 194
purpose 12
of 111
for 486
no 896
more 11
purpose 12
It 67
is 124
not 85
that 11
money 17
should 7
be 1205
on 86
side 74
and 51
it 67
might 9
strike 14
them 9
that 11
they 5
be 1205
more 11
though 12
less 19
married 3
in 2720
London 5
than 22
in 2720
But 82
why 4
all 162
this 6
Why 4
any 17
fear 14
of 111
Why 4
must 28
marriage 6
be 1205
private 9
Oh 17
no 896
no 896
this 6
is 124
not 85
His 43
most 3
particular 13
friend 15
you 30
see 70
by 57
account 14
was 93
of 111
his 43
never 3
to 805
her 182
will 40
never 3
a 6810
woman 21
some 30
money 17
He 965
afford 6
it 67
And 51
what 14
has 41
Lydia 5
what 14
attraction 3
has 41
she 199
youth 7
health 12
and 51
good 28
that 11
make 17
him 9
for 486
her 182
sake 3
forego 4
every 10
chance 20
of 111
by 57
well 24
As 509
to 805
what 14
restraint 3
the 194
of 111
disgrace 8
in 2720
the 194
corps 8
might 9
throw 14
on 86
a 6810
elopement 3
with 34
her 182
I 4331
am 394
not 85
able 3
to 805
judge 7
for 486
I 4331
know 12
nothing 5
of 111
the 194
that 11
a 6810
step 48
might 9
produce 7
But 82
as 509
to 805
your 4
other 6
objection 5
I 4331
am 394
it 67
will 40
hold 22
good 28
Lydia 5
has 41
no 896
to 805
step 48
forward 12
and 51
he 965
might 9
imagine 3
my 90
his 43
and 51
the 194
little 6
attention 3
he 965
has 41
ever 33
to 805
give 15
to 805
what 14
was 93
going 3
forward 12
in 2720
his 43
that 11
he 965
would 5
do 815
as 509
little 6
and 51
think 8
as 509
little 6
it 67
as 509
any 17
father 12
do 815
in 2720
a 6810
matter 7
But 82
can 288
you 30
think 8
that 11
Lydia 5
is 124
so 797
to 805
but 82
love 30
of 111
him 9
as 509
to 805
consent 5
to 805
live 43
with 34
him 9
on 86
any 17
other 6
than 22
marriage 6
It 67
does 5
seem 10
and 51
it 67
is 124
most 3
Elizabeth 5
with 34
in 2720
her 182
eyes 8
that 11
a 6810
sense 8
of 111
and 51
virtue 3
in 2720
a 6810
point 22
should 7
admit 7
of 111
doubt 15
But 82
I 4331
know 12
not 85
what 14
to 805
say 7
I 4331
am 394
not 85
doing 3
her 182
justice 3
But 82
she 199
is 124
young 10
she 199
has 41
never 3
to 805
think 8
on 86
serious 4
and 51
for 486
the 194
last 7
half 23
year 20
nay 6
for 486
a 6810
twelvemonth 3
she 199
has 41
given 3
up 194
to 805
nothing 5
but 82
amusement 3
and 51
She 199
has 41
to 805
dispose 6
of 111
her 182
time 45
in 2720
the 194
most 3
idle 10
and 51
frivolous 4
manner 8
and 51
to 805
adopt 12
any 17
that 11
came 36
in 2720
her 182
way 27
Since 7
the 194
shire 3
were 5
first 8
in 2720
nothing 5
but 82
love 30
flirtation 3
and 51
have 11
in 2720
her 182
head 140
She 199
has 41
doing 3
in 2720
her 182
power 19
by 57
and 51
on 86
the 194
subject 11
to 805
give 15
what 14
shall 12
I 4331
call 57
it 67
to 805
her 182
are 12
And 51
we 446
all 162
know 12
that 11
has 41
every 10
charm 14
of 111
person 33
and 51
address 9
that 11
can 288
captivate 3
a 6810
woman 21
But 82
you 30
see 70
that 11
Jane 9
her 182
aunt 6
does 5
not 85
think 8
so 797
ill 84
of 111
as 509
to 805
believe 6
him 9
of 111
the 194
attempt 5
Of 111
whom 3
does 5
Jane 9
ever 33
think 8
ill 84
And 51
who 79
is 124
there 21
might 9
be 1205
former 3
conduct 21
that 11
she 199
would 5
think 8
of 111
an 973
attempt 5
till 14
it 67
were 5
them 9
But 82
Jane 9
as 509
well 24
as 509
I 4331
do 815
what 14
is 124
We 446
both 8
know 12
that 11
he 965
has 41
profligate 4
in 2720
every 10
sense 8
of 111
the 194
word 26
that 11
he 965
has 41
nor 102
honour 4
that 11
he 965
is 124
as 509
false 12
and 51
deceitful 4
as 509
he 965
is 124
And 51
do 815
you 30
know 12
all 162
this 6
Gardiner 3
as 509
to 805
the 194
mode 57
of 111
her 182
was 93
all 162
alive 3
I 4331
do 815
Elizabeth 5
I 4331
you 30
the 194
other 6
day 27
of 111
his 43
to 805
Mr 5
and 51
you 30
when 6
last 7
at 272
in 2720
what 14
manner 8
he 965
spoke 14
of 111
the 194
man 343
who 79
had 11
with 34
and 51
him 9
And 51
there 21
are 12
other 6
I 4331
am 394
not 85
at 272
it 67
is 124
not 85
worth 15
while 4
to 805
relate 8
but 82
his 43
the 194
whole 26
are 12
endless 4
what 14
he 965
of 111
Miss 72
I 4331
was 93
prepared 3
to 805
see 70
a 6810
proud 5
reserved 4
disagreeable 3
girl 14
Yet 4
he 965
to 805
the 194
He 965
must 28
know 12
that 11
she 199
was 93
as 509
and 51
as 509
we 446
have 11
found 18
her 182
But 82
does 5
Lydia 5
know 12
nothing 5
of 111
this 6
can 288
she 199
be 1205
of 111
what 14
you 30
and 51
Jane 9
seem 10
so 797
well 24
to 805
understand 8
Oh 17
yes 16
that 11
that 11
is 124
the 194
worst 6
of 111
all 162
Till 14
I 4331
was 93
in 2720
Kent 9
and 51
saw 24
so 797
both 8
of 111
Mr 5
and 51
his 43
relation 8
Colonel 5
I 4331
was 93
of 111
the 194
truth 7
And 51
when 6
I 4331
home 90
the 194
shire 3
was 93
to 805
leave 14
in 2720
a 6810
week 20
or 333
time 45
As 509
that 11
was 93
the 194
case 25
Jane 9
to 805
whom 3
I 4331
related 3
the 194
whole 26
nor 102
I 4331
thought 11
it 67
to 805
make 17
our 3
knowledge 4
public 18
for 486
of 111
what 14
use 18
it 67
be 1205
to 805
any 17
one 19
that 11
the 194
good 28
opinion 4
all 162
the 194
had 11
of 111
him 9
should 7
then 5
be 1205
And 51
even 36
when 6
it 67
was 93
that 11
Lydia 5
should 7
go 500
with 34
the 194
of 111
opening 3
her 182
eyes 8
to 805
his 43
character 17
never 3
to 805
me 1043
That 11
she 199
be 1205
in 2720
any 17
danger 7
the 194
deception 3
never 3
my 90
head 140
That 11
a 6810
consequence 3
as 509
this 6
ensue 3
you 30
may 49
believe 6
was 93

conversation 8
together 3
them 9
as 509
might 9
be 1205
with 34
and 51
of 111
regret 9
the 194
conduct 21
of 111

of 111
her 182

the 194

to 805
ill 84
indulgence 3
the 194

out 365

sure 11
there 21

some 30
great 12
neglect 9
or 333
other 6
on 86

Mr 5
Gardiner 3
though 12
he 965
assured 4
her 182
of 111
his 43
earnest 8
in 2721
the 194
cause 14
not 85
avoid 8
to 805
her 182
as 509
well 24
in 2721
her 182
as 509
her 182
fear 14
and 51
after 48
with 34
her 182
in 2721
this 6
manner 8
till 14
dinner 9
was 93
on 86
the 194
table 27
they 5
all 162
left 19
her 182
to 805
vent 41
all 162
her 182
on 86
the 194
housekeeper 3
who 79
in 2721
the 194
absence 3
of 111
her 182
Though 12
her 182
brother 9
and 51
sister 10
were 5
that 11
there 21
was 93
no 896
real 48
occasion 7
for 487
a 6810
the 194
they 5
did 23
not 85
attempt 5
to 805
oppose 3
it 67
for 487
they 5
that 11
she 199
had 11
not 85
to 805
hold 22
her 182
tongue 5
the 194
while 4
they 5
at 272
table 27
and 51
it 67
better 7
that 11
one 19
of 111
the 194
household 6
and 51
the 194
one 19
whom 3
they 5
most 3
trust 26
should 7
comprehend 4
all 162
her 182
and 51
on 86
the 194
subject 11
In 2721
the 194
room 22
they 5
were 5
soon 3
by 57
Mary 13
and 51
who 79
had 11
too 50
in 2721
separate 7
to 805
make 17
appearance 3
One 19
came 36
her 182
books 15
and 51
the 194
other 6
her 182
The 194
of 111
both 8
were 5
calm 10
and 51
no 896
change 21
was 93
in 2721
except 10
that 11
the 194
loss 3
of 111
her 182
favourite 3
sister 10
or 333
the 194
anger 5
she 199
had 11
in 2721
this 6
business 13
had 11
given 3
more 11
of 111
than 22
usual 3
to 805
the 194
of 111
As 509
for 487
Mary 13
she 199
was 93
mistress 3
of 111
to 805
whisper 8
to 805
Elizabeth 5
with 34
a 6810
countenance 4
of 111
grave 28
reflection 3
soon 3
after 48
they 5
were 5
at 272
table 27
This 6
is 124
a 6810
most 3
unfortunate 4
affair 3
and 51
will 40
be 1205
of 111
But 82
we 446
must 28
stem 8
the 194
tide 15
of 111
and 51
pour 5
into 26
the 194
of 111
other 6
the 194
balm 8
of 111
consolation 3
Then 5
in 2721
Elizabeth 5
no 896
inclination 3
of 111
she 199
as 509
the 194
event 18
must 28
be 1205
for 487
Lydia 5
we 446
may 49
draw 24
it 67
this 6
useful 4
lesson 3
that 11
loss 3
of 111
virtue 3
in 2721
a 6810
female 5
is 124
that 11
one 19
false 12
step 48
her 182
in 2721
endless 4
ruin 10
that 11
her 182
reputation 3
is 124
no 896
less 19
brittle 6
than 22
it 67
is 124
and 51
that 11
she 199
be 1205
too 50
in 2721
her 182
the 194
of 111
the 194
other 6
sex 45
Elizabeth 5
up 194
her 182
eyes 8
in 2721
but 82
was 93
too 50
to 805
make 17
any 17
reply 3
Mary 13
to 805
console 4
with 34
kind 31
of 111
moral 25
the 194
evil 15
them 9
In 2721
the 194
afternoon 3
the 194
two 14
elder 7
Miss 72
were 5
able 3
to 805
be 1205
for 487
half 23
an 973
hour 10
by 57
and 51
Elizabeth 5
of 111
the 194
of 111
making 4
any 17

was 93
eager 6
to 805
satisfy 3
After 48
in 2721
general 22
over 598
the 194
dreadful 4
sequel 3
of 111
this 6
event 18

not 85
assert 11
to 805
be 1205
the 194
former 3
the 194
subject 11
by 57
saying 3
But 82
tell 16
me 1043
all 162
and 51
it 67
I 4332
have 11
not 85
Give 15
me 1043
further 8
What 14
did 23
Colonel 5
Forster 3
say 7
Had 11
they 5
no 896
apprehension 3
of 111
anything 3
the 194
elopement 3
place 29
They 5
must 28
have 11
them 9
together 3
for 487
ever 33
Colonel 5
Forster 3
did 23
own 9
that 11
he 965
had 11
often 4
some 30
on 86
side 74
but 82
nothing 5
to 805
give 15
him 9
any 17
alarm 9
I 4332
am 394
so 797
for 487
him 9
His 43
was 93
attentive 4
and 51
kind 31
to 805
the 194
He 965
was 93
coming 3
to 805
us 70
in 2721
order 11
to 805
assure 6
us 70
of 111
his 43
concern 6
he 965
had 11
any 17
idea 21
of 111
not 85
being 3
gone 4
to 805
when 6
that 11
apprehension 3
first 8
got 14
it 67
his 43
journey 11
And 51
was 93
that 11
would 5
not 85
Did 23
he 965
know 12
of 111
to 805
go 500
off 102
Had 11
Colonel 5
Forster 3
Yes 16
but 82
when 6
by 57
him 9
knowing 3
anything 3
of 111
and 51
would 5
not 85
give 15
his 43
real 48
opinion 4
it 67
He 965
did 23
not 85
repeat 12
his 43
persuasion 3
of 111
not 85
and 51
that 11
I 4332
am 394
to 805
hope 16
he 965
might 9
have 11
And 51
till 14
Colonel 5
Forster 3
came 36
not 85
one 19
of 111
you 30
a 6810
doubt 15
I 4332
suppose 4
of 111
being 3
married 3
How 27
was 93
it 67
possible 3
that 11
an 973
idea 21
should 7
enter 23
our 3
brains 7
I 4332
felt 5
a 6810
little 6
a 6810
little 6
fearful 4
of 111
my 90
with 34
him 9
in 2721
marriage 6
I 4332
that 11
his 43
conduct 21
had 11
not 85
right 31
My 90
father 12
and 51
mother 21
nothing 5
of 111
that 11
they 5
felt 5
how 27
a 6810
match 25
it 67
must 28
be 1205
then 5
with 34
a 6810
natural 18
triumph 10
on 86
knowing 3
more 11
than 22
the 194
rest 110
of 111
us 70
that 11
in 2721
last 7
letter 20
she 199
had 11
prepared 3
her 182
for 487
a 6810
step 48
She 199
had 11
it 67
of 111
being 3
in 2721
love 30
with 34
other 6
But 82
not 85
they 5
to 805
No 896
I 4332
believe 6
not 85
And 51
did 23
Colonel 5
Forster 3
appear 7
to 805
think 8
well 24
of 111
Does 5
he 965
know 12
his 43
real 48
character 17
I 4332
must 28
confess 14
that 11
he 965
did 23
not 85
speak 12
so 797
well 24
of 111
as 509
he 965
did 23
He 965
him 9
to 805
be 1205
and 51
And 51
since 7
this 6
sad 47
affair 3
has 41
place 29
it 67
is 124
that 11
he 965
left 19
in 2721
debt 6
but 82
I 4332
hope 16
this 6
may 49
be 1205
false 12
Oh 17
Jane 9
had 11
we 446
less 19
secret 25
had 11
we 446
what 14
we 446
of 111
him 9
this 6
not 85
have 11
it 67
would 5
have 11
better 7
her 182
sister 10
But 82
to 805
expose 4
the 194
former 3
of 111
any 17
person 33
knowing 3
what 14
present 20
were 5
We 446
with 34
the 194
best 37
Colonel 5
Forster 3
repeat 12
the 194
of 111
note 16
to 805
his 43
wife 6
He 965
it 67
with 34
him 9
for 487
us 70
to 805
see 70
Jane 9
then 5
it 67
her 182
pocket 14

gave 4
it 67
to 805
Elizabeth 5
These 4
were 5

Your 4

LYDIA 5
BENNET 4
Oh 17
thoughtless 4
thoughtless 4
Lydia 5
Elizabeth 5
when 6
she 199
had 11
it 67
What 14
a 6810
letter 20
is 124
this 6
to 805
be 1205
at 272
a 6810
moment 15
But 82
at 272
least 3
it 67
shows 5
that 11
she 199
was 93
serious 4
on 86
the 194
subject 11
of 111
journey 11
he 965
might 9
persuade 6
her 182
to 805
it 67
was 93
not 85
on 86
her 182
side 74
a 6810
scheme 7
of 111
My 90
poor 11
father 12
how 27
he 965
must 28
have 11
felt 5
it 67
I 4332
never 3
saw 24
so 797
He 965
not 85
speak 12
a 6810
word 26
for 487
full 16
ten 151
minutes 3
My 90
mother 21
was 93
ill 84
and 51
the 194
whole 26
house 87
in 2721
confusion 3
Oh 17
Jane 9
Elizabeth 5
was 93
there 21
a 6810
servant 3
belonging 3
to 805
it 67
who 79
did 23
not 85
know 12
the 194
whole 26
story 13
the 194
end 96
of 111
the 194
day 27
I 4332
do 815
not 85
know 12
I 4332
hope 16
there 21
was 93
But 82
to 805
be 1205
at 272
a 6810
time 45
is 124
difficult 5
My 90
mother 21
was 93
in 2721
and 51
though 12
I 4332
to 805
give 15
her 182
every 10
in 2721
my 90
power 19
I 4332
am 394
I 4332
did 23
not 85
do 815
so 797
as 509
I 4332
might 9
have 11
done 3
But 82
the 194
horror 3
of 111
what 14
might 9
happen 9
me 1043
my 90
Your 4
attendance 3
her 182
has 41
too 50
for 487
you 30
You 30
do 815
not 85
look 14
well 24
Oh 17
that 11
I 4332
had 11
with 34
you 30
you 30
have 11
had 11
every 10
care 47
and 51
Mary 13
and 51
have 11
kind 31
and 51
would 5
have 11
in 2721
every 10
fatigue 5
I 4332
am 394
sure 11
but 82
I 4332
did 23
not 85
think 8
it 67
right 31
for 487
of 111
them 9
is 124
slight 11
and 51
delicate 7
and 51
Mary 13
so 797
that 11
her 182
of 111
repose 5
should 7
not 85
be 1205
broken 6
in 2721
on 86
My 90
aunt 6
Phillips 3
came 36
to 805
on 86
Tuesday 3
after 48
my 90
father 12
and 51
was 93
so 797
good 28
as 509
to 805
stay 7
till 14
Thursday 3
with 34
me 1043
She 199
was 93
of 111
great 12
use 18
and 51
comfort 14
to 805
us 70
all 162
And 51
Lady 18
Lucas 3
has 41
kind 31
she 199
here 31
on 86
Wednesday 3
morning 3
to 805
condole 6
with 34
us 70
and 51
her 182
or 333
any 17
of 111
her 182
if 8
they 5
should 7
be 1205
of 111
use 18
to 805
us 70
She 199
had 11
better 7
have 11
at 272
home 90
Elizabeth 5
she 199
meant 3
well 24
but 82
under 288
a 6810
misfortune 3
as 509
this 6
one 19
see 70
too 50
little 6
of 111
is 124
condolence 3
Let 50
them 9
triumph 10
over 598
us 70
at 272
a 6810
distance 4
and 51
be 1205
She 199
then 5
to 805
inquire 6
into 26
the 194
her 182
father 12
had 11
intended 3
to 805
pursue 6
while 4
in 2721
town 27
for 487
the 194
of 111
his 43
daughter 5
He 965
meant 3
I 4332
believe 6
Jane 9
to 805
go 500
to 805
the 194
place 29
where 21
they 5
last 7
horses 7
see 70
the 194
and 51
try 12
if 8
anything 3
be 1205
made 13
out 365
them 9
His 43
principal 7
object 26
must 28
be 1205
to 805
discover 10
the 194
number 8
of 111
the 194
hackney 5
coach 11
them 9
It 67
had 11
come 36
with 34
a 6810
fare 7
London 5
and 51
as 509
he 965
thought 11
that 11
the 194
circumstance 4
of 111
a 6810
gentleman 4
and 51
one 19
carriage 5
into 26
might 9
be 1205
he 965
meant 3
to 805
make 17
at 272
If 8
he 965
discover 10
at 272
what 14
house 87
the 194
had 11
set 40
down 90
his 43
fare 7
he 965
to 805
make 17
there 21
and 51
it 67
might 9
not 85
be 1205
to 805
find 10
out 365
the 194
stand 42
and 51
number 8
of 111
the 194
coach 11
I 4332
do 815
not 85
know 12
of 111
any 17
other 6
that 11
he 965
had 11
but 82
he 965
was 93
in 2721
a 6810
hurry 3
to 805
be 1205
gone 4
and 51
his 43
so 797
that 11
I 4332
had 11
in 2721
finding 4
out 365
even 36
so 797
as 509
this 6
Chapter 3
The 194
whole 26
party 3
were 5
in 2721
of 111
a 6810
letter 20
Mr 5
Bennet 4
the 194
morning 3
but 82
the 194
post 113
came 36
in 2721
a 6810
single 15
line 36
him 9
His 43
him 9
to 805
be 1205
on 86
all 162
common 23
a 6810
most 3
and 51
correspondent 3
but 82
at 272
a 6810
time 45
they 5
had 11
for 487
exertion 3
They 5
were 5
to 805
conclude 3
that 11
he 965
had 11
no 896
pleasing 3
to 805
send 10
but 82
even 36
of 111
that 11
they 5
would 5
have 11
glad 30
to 805
be 1205
certain 5
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
had 11
for 487
the 194
he 965
set 40
off 102
When 6
he 965
was 93
gone 4
they 5
were 5
certain 5
at 272
least 3
of 111
constant 7
information 3
of 111
what 14
was 93
going 3
on 86
and 51
uncle 18
at 272
parting 3
to 805
prevail 4
on 86
Mr 5
Bennet 4
to 805
return 14
to 805
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 965
to 805
the 194
great 12
consolation 3
of 111
his 43
sister 10
who 79
it 67
as 509
the 194
for 487
her 182
not 85
being 3
in 2721
a 6810
duel 12
Gardiner 3
and 51
the 194
were 5
to 805
remain 9
in 2721
a 6810
few 6
as 509
the 194
former 3
thought 11
her 182
presence 3
might 9
be 1205
to 805
her 182
She 199
in 2721
attendance 3
on 86
Bennet 4
and 51
was 93
a 6810
great 12
comfort 14
to 805
them 9
in 2721
of 111
freedom 3
other 6
aunt 6
also 3
them 9
and 51
as 509
she 199
with 34
the 194
design 17
of 111
and 51
them 9
up 194
though 12
as 509
she 199
never 3
came 36
some 30
fresh 22
instance 4
of 111
extravagance 3
or 333
she 199
leaving 3
them 9
more 11
than 22
she 199
found 18
them 9
All 162
to 805
blacken 4
the 194
man 343
who 79
but 82
three 12
had 11
an 973
angel 27
of 111
light 42
He 965
was 93
to 805
be 1205
in 2721
debt 6
to 805
every 10
in 2721
the 194
place 29
and 51
his 43
all 162
with 34
the 194
title 7
of 111
seduction 3
had 11
into 26
every 10
that 11
he 965
was 93
the 194
young 10
man 343
in 2721
the 194
world 12
and 51
to 805
find 10
out 365
that 11
they 5
had 11
the 194
appearance 3
of 111
his 43
Elizabeth 5
though 12
she 199
did 23
not 85
credit 12
above 3
half 23
of 111
what 14
was 93
to 805
make 17
her 182
former 3
assurance 3
of 111
her 182
ruin 10
more 11
certain 5
and 51
even 36
Jane 9
who 79
still 13
less 19
of 111
it 67
hopeless 4
more 11
as 509
the 194
time 45

when 6
if 8

Mr 5

all 162
the 194
principal 7
in 2721
town 27
as 509
Mr 5
Bennet 4
thought 11
it 67
possible 3
they 5
might 9
have 11
gone 4
to 805
one 19
of 111
them 9
on 86
first 8
coming 3
to 805
London 5
they 5
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
did 23
not 85
expect 20
any 17
success 13
this 6
measure 8
but 82
as 509
his 43
brother 9
was 93
eager 6
in 2721
it 67
he 965
meant 3
to 805
assist 10
him 9
in 2721
it 67
He 965
that 11
Mr 5
Bennet 4
at 272
present 20
to 805
leave 14
London 5
and 51
to 805
write 5
soon 3
There 21
was 93
also 3
a 6810
postscript 3
to 805
this 6
effect 15
I 4332
have 11
to 805
Colonel 5
Forster 3
to 805
desire 6
him 9
to 805
find 10
out 365
if 8
possible 3
some 30
of 111
the 194
young 10
in 2721
the 194
regiment 9
has 41
any 17
relations 5
or 333
who 79
would 5
be 1205
to 805
know 12
in 2721
what 14
part 102
of 111
town 27
he 965
has 41
now 10
If 8
there 21
were 5
that 11
one 19
to 805
with 34
a 6810
of 111
a 6810
clue 5
as 509
that 11
it 67
might 9
be 1205
of 111
essential 4
consequence 3
At 272
present 20
we 446
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
guide 16
us 70
Colonel 5
Forster 3
will 40
I 4332
dare 15
say 7
do 815
in 2721
his 43
power 19
to 805
satisfy 3
us 70
on 86
this 6
head 140
But 82
on 86
second 16
tell 16
us 70
what 14
relations 5
he 965
has 41
now 10
living 5
better 7
than 22
any 17
other 6
person 33
Elizabeth 5
was 93
at 272
no 896
loss 3
to 805
understand 8
this 6
to 805
her 182
but 82
it 67
was 93
not 85
in 2721
her 182
power 19
to 805
give 15
any 17
information 3
of 111
so 797
a 6810
nature 5
as 509
the 194
compliment 6
She 199
had 11
never 3
of 111
his 43
had 11
any 17
relations 5
except 10
a 6810
father 12
and 51
mother 21
both 8
of 111
whom 3
had 11
dead 39
It 67
was 93
possible 3
that 11
some 30
of 111
his 43
companions 3
in 2721
the 194
shire 3
might 9
be 1205
able 3
to 805
give 15
more 11
information 3
and 51
though 12
she 199
was 93
not 85
in 2721
it 67
the 194
application 3
was 93
a 6810
something 3
to 805
look 14
forward 12
to 805
Every 10
day 27
at 272
was 93
now 10
a 6810
day 27
of 111
but 82
the 194
most 3
anxious 4
part 102
of 111
was 93
when 6
the 194
post 113
was 93
The 194
arrival 3
of 111
was 93
the 194
grand 74
object 26
of 111
every 10
impatience 3
Through 4
of 111
good 28
or 333
bad 33
was 93
to 805
be 1205
would 5
be 1205
and 51
every 10
day 27
was 93
to 805
bring 6
some 30
news 71
of 111
But 82
they 5
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
a 6810
letter 20
for 487
father 12
a 6810
different 11
quarter 25
Mr 5
Collins 3
as 509
Jane 9
had 11
to 805
open 21
all 162
that 11
came 36
for 487
him 9
in 2721
his 43
absence 3
she 199
read 49
and 51
Elizabeth 5
who 79
what 14
his 43
were 5
over 598
her 182
and 51
read 49
it 67
It 67
was 93
as 509
My 90
dear 15
Sir 22
I 4332
feel 11
by 57
our 3
relationship 3
and 51
my 90
situation 3
in 2721
life 44
to 805
condole 6
with 34
you 30
on 86
the 194
grievous 4
affliction 3
you 30
are 12
now 10
suffering 3
under 288
of 111
we 446
were 5
yesterday 3
by 57
a 6810
letter 20
Be 1205
assured 4
my 90
dear 15
sir 22
that 11
Collins 3
and 51
with 34
you 30
and 51
all 162
your 4
in 2721
your 4
present 20
distress 7
must 28
be 1205
of 111
the 194
kind 31
proceeding 3
a 6810
cause 14
no 896
time 45
can 288
remove 7
No 896
shall 12
be 1205
on 86
my 90
part 102
that 11
can 288
alleviate 3
so 797
severe 7
a 6810
misfortune 3
or 333
that 11
may 49
comfort 14
you 30
under 288
a 6810
circumstance 4
that 11
must 28
be 1205
of 111
all 162
the 194
most 3
to 805
a 6810
mind 25
The 194
death 19
of 111
your 4
daughter 5
would 5
have 11
a 6810
blessing 3
in 2721
comparison 3
of 111
this 6
And 51
it 67
is 124
the 194
more 11
to 805
be 1205
there 21
is 124
reason 13
to 805
suppose 4
as 509
my 90
dear 15
Charlotte 4
me 1043
that 11
this 6
of 111
in 2721
your 4
daughter 5
has 41
a 6810
degree 3
of 111
indulgence 3
though 12
at 272
the 194
same 5
time 45
for 487
the 194
consolation 3
of 111
and 51
Bennet 4
I 4332
am 394
to 805
think 8
that 11
her 182
own 9
disposition 3
must 28
be 1205
bad 33
or 333
she 199
not 85
be 1205
of 111
an 973
at 272
so 797
an 973
age 24
that 11
may 49
be 1205
you 30
are 12
to 805
be 1205
in 2721
opinion 4
I 4332
am 394
not 85
by 57
Collins 3
but 82
by 57
Lady 18
and 51
her 182
daughter 5
to 805
whom 3
I 4332
have 11
related 3
the 194
affair 3
They 5
agree 11
with 34
me 1043
in 2721
that 11
this 6
false 12
step 48
in 2721
one 19
daughter 5
will 40
be 1205
to 805
the 194
of 111
all 162
the 194
for 487
who 79
as 509
Lady 18
will 40
connect 18
with 34
a 6810
And 51
this 6
consideration 3
me 1043
to 805
reflect 12
with 34
satisfaction 3
on 86
a 6810
certain 5
event 18
of 111
last 7
November 3
for 487
had 11
it 67
I 4332
must 28
have 11
in 2721
all 162
your 4
sorrow 9
and 51
disgrace 8
Let 50
me 1043
then 5
advise 9
you 30
dear 15
sir 22
to 805
console 4
as 509
as 509
possible 3
to 805
throw 14
off 102
your 4
child 28
your 4
affection 5
for 487
ever 33
and 51
leave 14
her 182
to 805
reap 40
the 194
of 111
her 182
own 9
heinous 4
offense 3
I 4332
am 394
dear 15
sir 22
etc 10
etc 10
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
did 23
not 85
write 5
till 14
he 965
had 11
an 973
answer 8
Colonel 5
Forster 3
and 51
then 5
he 965
had 11
nothing 5
of 111
a 6810
pleasant 9
nature 5
to 805
send 10
It 67
was 93
not 85
that 11
had 11
a 6810
single 15
relationship 3
with 34
whom 3
he 965
up 194
any 17
connection 3
and 51
it 67
was 93
certain 5
that 11
he 965
had 11
no 896
near 15
one 19
living 5
His 43
former 3
acquaintances 3
had 11
but 82
since 7
he 965
had 11
in 2721
the 194
militia 6
it 67
did 23
not 85
appear 7
that 11
he 965
was 93
on 86
of 111
particular 13
friendship 3
with 34
any 17
of 111
them 9
There 21
was 93
no 896
one 19
who 79
be 1205
out 365
as 509
to 805
give 15
any 17
news 71
of 111
him 9
And 51
in 2721
the 194
wretched 6
state 41
of 111
his 43
own 9
there 21
was 93
a 6810
motive 4
for 487
in 2721
addition 5
to 805
his 43
fear 14
of 111
by 57
relations 5
for 487
it 67
had 11
just 24
that 11
he 965
had 11
left 19
behind 4
him 9
to 805
a 6810
amount 5
Colonel 5
Forster 3
that 11
more 11
than 22
a 6810
thousand 7
would 5
be 1205
to 805
clear 23
his 43
at 272
He 965
a 6810
good 28
deal 13
in 2721
town 27
but 82
his 43
of 111
honour 4
were 5
still 13
more 11
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
did 23
not 85
attempt 5
to 805
conceal 10
these 4
the 194
Jane 9
them 9
with 34
horror 3
A 6810
gamester 3
she 199
This 6
is 124
unexpected 4
I 4332
had 11
not 85
an 973
idea 21
of 111
it 67
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
in 2721
his 43
letter 20
that 11
they 5
might 9
expect 20
to 805
see 70
father 12
at 272
home 90
on 86
the 194
following 3
day 27
was 93
Saturday 3
by 57
the 194
ill 84
success 13
of 111
all 162
he 965
had 11
to 805
his 43
brother 9
in 2721
that 11
he 965
would 5
return 14
to 805
his 43
and 51
leave 14
it 67
to 805
him 9
to 805
do 815
occasion 7
might 9
suggest 15
to 805
be 1205
for 487
pursuit 3
When 6
Bennet 4
was 93
of 111
this 6
she 199
did 23
not 85
express 25
so 797
satisfaction 3
as 509
her 182
what 14
her 182
for 487
his 43
life 44
had 11
What 14
is 124
he 965
coming 3
home 90
and 51
poor 11
Lydia 5
she 199
Sure 11
he 965
will 40
not 85
leave 14
London 5
he 965
has 41
found 18
them 9
Who 79
is 124
to 805
fight 9
and 51
make 17
him 9
her 182
if 8
he 965
comes 4
As 509
Gardiner 3
to 805
wish 13
to 805
be 1205
at 272
home 90
it 67
was 93
that 11
she 199
and 51
the 194
should 7
go 500
to 805
London 5
at 272
the 194
same 5
time 45
that 11
Mr 5
Bennet 4
came 36
it 67
The 194
coach 11

the 194
first 8
stage 13
of 111
journey 11
and 51
master 28
back 182
to 805
Gardiner 3
in 2721
all 162
the 194
Elizabeth 5
and 51
her 182
friend 15
that 11
had 11
her 182
that 11
part 102
of 111
the 194
world 12
His 43
name 17
had 11
never 3
them 9
by 57
her 182
niece 3
and 51
the 194
kind 31
of 111
half 23
expectation 3
Gardiner 3
had 11
of 111
being 3
by 57
a 6810
letter 20
him 9
had 11
in 2721
nothing 5
Elizabeth 5
had 11
none 32
since 7
her 182
return 14
that 11
come 36
The 194
present 20
state 41
of 111
the 194
any 17
other 6
excuse 4
for 487
the 194
of 111
her 182
nothing 5
be 1205
that 11
though 12
Elizabeth 5
who 79
was 93
by 57
this 6
time 45
well 24
with 34
her 182
own 9
was 93
aware 3
that 11
had 11
she 199
nothing 5
of 111
she 199
have 11
borne 3
the 194
dread 14
of 111
better 7
It 67
would 5
have 11
her 182
she 199
thought 11
one 19
sleepless 4
night 61
out 365
of 111
two 14
When 6
Mr 5
Bennet 4
he 965
had 11
all 162
the 194
appearance 3
of 111
his 43
usual 3
philosophic 3
He 965
as 509
little 6
as 509
he 965
had 11
ever 33
in 2721
the 194
habit 25
of 111
saying 3
made 13
no 896
mention 5
of 111
the 194
business 13
that 11
had 11
him 9
and 51
it 67
was 93
some 30
time 45
his 43
had 11
courage 6
to 805
speak 12
of 111
it 67
It 67
was 93
not 85
till 14
the 194
afternoon 3
when 6
he 965
had 11
them 9
at 272
tea 99
that 11
Elizabeth 5
to 805
introduce 3
the 194
subject 11
and 51
then 5
on 86
her 182
her 182
sorrow 9
for 487
what 14
he 965
must 28
have 11
he 965
Say 7
nothing 5
of 111
that 11
Who 79
should 7
suffer 11
but 82
It 67
has 41
my 90
own 9
doing 3
and 51
I 4332
to 805
feel 11
it 67
You 30
must 28
not 85
be 1205
too 50
severe 7
Elizabeth 5
You 30
may 49
well 24
warn 8
me 1043
an 973
evil 15
Human 41
nature 5
is 124
so 797
prone 3
to 805
fall 29
into 26
it 67
No 896
let 50
me 1043
in 2721
my 90
life 44
feel 11
how 27
I 4332
have 11
to 805
blame 13
I 4332
am 394
not 85
of 111
being 3
by 57
the 194
impression 12
It 67
will 40
pass 66
soon 3
Do 815
you 30
suppose 4
them 9
to 805
be 1205
in 2721
London 5
Yes 16
where 21
can 288
they 5
be 1205
so 797
well 24
And 51
Lydia 5
to 805
want 13
to 805
go 500
to 805
London 5
She 199
is 124
then 5
her 182
father 12
and 51
her 182
residence 3
there 21
will 40
be 1205
of 111
some 30
Then 5
after 48
a 6810
short 62
silence 7
he 965
I 4332
bear 30
you 30
no 896
ill 84
will 40
for 487
being 3
in 2721
your 4
to 805
me 1043
last 7
May 49
the 194
event 18
shows 5
some 30
of 111
mind 25
They 5
were 5
by 57
Miss 72
Bennet 4
who 79
came 36
to 805
fetch 8
her 182
tea 99
This 6
is 124
a 6810
parade 7

And 51
so 797
saying 3

with 34
them 9
and 51
the 194
house 87
And 51
may 49
I 4332
ask 6
Elizabeth 5
but 82
the 194
I 4332
suppose 4
must 28
be 1205
with 34
with 34
I 4332
am 394

And 51
they 5
must 28
Yet 4
he 965
is 124
a 6810
man 343
Yes 16
yes 16
they 5
must 28
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
to 805
be 1205
done 3
But 82
there 21
are 12
two 14
that 11
I 4332
want 13
to 805

one 19
is 124
how 27
money 17
your 4
uncle 18
has 41
down 90
to 805
bring 6
it 67
and 51
the 194
other 6
how 27
am 394
I 4332
ever 33

pay 52
him 9
Money 17
My 90
uncle 18
Jane 9
what 14
do 815
you 30
mean 36
sir 22
I 4332
mean 36
that 11
no 896
man 343
in 2721
his 43
would 5
Lydia 5
on 86
so 797
slight 11
a 6810
temptation 3
as 509
one 19
hundred 10
a 6810
year 20
my 90
life 44
and 51
after 48
I 4332
am 394
gone 4
That 11
is 124
true 9
Elizabeth 5
though 12
it 67
had 11
not 85
to 805
me 1043
His 43
to 805
be 1205
and 51
something 3
still 13
to 805
remain 9
Oh 17
it 67
must 28
be 1205
my 90
Generous 4
good 28
man 343
I 4332
am 394
he 965
has 41
A 6810
small 14
sum 70
not 85
do 815
all 162
this 6
No 896
her 182
father 12
a 6810
fool 21
if 8
he 965
her 182
with 34
a 6810
farthing 3
less 19
than 22
ten 151
thousand 7
I 4332
should 7
be 1205
to 805
think 8
so 797
ill 84
of 111
him 9
in 2721
the 194
beginning 3
of 111
our 3
relationship 3
Ten 151
thousand 7
Heaven 9
forbid 6
How 27
is 124
half 23
a 6810
sum 70
to 805
be 1205
Mr 5
Bennet 4
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
of 111
them 9
deep 12
in 2721
thought 11
silent 6
till 14
they 5
the 194
house 87
father 12
then 5
on 86
to 805
the 194
to 805
write 5
and 51
the 194
into 26
the 194
breakfast 5
room 22
And 51
they 5
are 12
to 805
be 1205
married 3
Elizabeth 5
as 509
soon 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
by 57
How 27
strange 8
this 6
is 124
And 51
for 487
this 6
we 446
are 12
to 805
be 1205
thankful 4
That 11
they 5
should 7
small 14
as 509
is 124
chance 20
of 111
and 51
wretched 6
as 509
is 124
his 43
character 17
we 446
are 12
to 805
rejoice 3
Oh 17
Lydia 5
I 4332
comfort 14
with 34
Jane 9
that 11
he 965
would 5
not 85
Lydia 5
if 8
he 965
had 11
not 85
a 6810
real 48
regard 7
for 487
her 182
Though 12
our 3
kind 31
uncle 18
has 41
done 3
something 3
clearing 6
him 9
I 4332
believe 6
that 11
ten 151
thousand 7
or 333
anything 3
like 22
it 67
has 41
He 965
has 41
of 111
his 43
own 9
and 51
may 49
have 11
more 11
How 27
he 965
spare 11
half 23
ten 151
thousand 7
If 8
he 965
were 5
ever 33
able 3
to 805
learn 10
what 14
have 11
Elizabeth 5
and 51
how 27
is 124
on 86
his 43
side 74
on 86
our 3
sister 10
we 446
shall 12
know 12
what 14
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
has 41
done 3
for 487
them 9
has 41
not 85
sixpence 3
of 111
his 43
own 9
The 194
kindness 3
of 111
my 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
can 288
never 3
be 1205
taking 4
her 182
home 90
and 51
her 182
personal 13
protection 8
and 51
countenance 4
is 124
a 6810
sacrifice 4
to 805
her 182
advantage 6
as 509
of 111
acknowledge 3
By 57
this 6
time 45
she 199
is 124
with 34
them 9
If 8
does 5
not 85
make 17
her 182
miserable 3
now 10
she 199
will 40
never 3
deserve 4
to 805
be 1205
What 14
a 6810
meeting 6
for 487
her 182
when 6
she 199
first 8
sees 6
my 90
aunt 6
We 446
must 28
endeavour 4
to 805
forget 8
all 162
that 11
has 41
on 86
side 74
Jane 9
I 4332
hope 16
and 51
trust 26
they 5
will 40
yet 4
be 1205
His 43
to 805

A 6811

Mr 5
Bennet 4
was 93
firm 16
It 67
soon 3
led 11
to 805

Bennet 4
found 18
with 34

horror 3
that 11

not 85
advance 7
a 6811

mark 47
of 111
affection 5
on 86
the 194
occasion 7
Bennet 4
comprehend 4
it 67
That 11
his 43
anger 5
be 1205
to 805
a 6811
point 22
of 111
resentment 3
as 510
to 805
refuse 4
his 43
daughter 5
a 6811
privilege 4
her 182
marriage 6
would 5
seem 10
valid 13
all 162
she 199
believe 6
possible 3
She 199
was 93
more 11
alive 3
to 805
the 194
disgrace 8
her 182
want 13
of 111
new 115
clothes 10
must 28
reflect 12
on 86

so 797
give 15
the 194
proper 9
termination 3

at 272
the 194

time 45

that 11
Mr 5
would 5
connect 18
with 34
a 6811
where 21
to 805
every 10
other 6
objection 5
would 5
now 10
be 1205
an 973
alliance 3
and 51
relationship 3
of 111
the 194
kind 31
with 34
a 6811
man 343

regard 7
she 199
had 11
assured 4

She 199
was 93

she 199
though 12
she 199
of 111
what 14
She 199
jealous 5
of 111
his 43
esteem 5
when 6
she 199

by 57

She 199
to 805
hear 78
of 111
him 9
when 6
there 21
the 194
least 3
chance 20
of 111
She 199
was 93
that 11
she 199
have 11
with 34
him 9
when 6
it 67
was 93
no 896
they 5
should 7
meet 9
What 14
a 6811
triumph 10
for 487
him 9
as 510
she 199
often 4
thought 11
he 965
know 12
that 11
the 194
she 199
had 11
four 26
ago 15
would 5
now 10
have 11
most 3
and 51
He 965
was 93
as 510
generous 4
she 199
not 85
as 510
the 194
most 3
generous 4
of 111
his 43
sex 45
but 82
while 4
he 965
was 93
mortal 6
there 21
must 28
be 1205
a 6811
triumph 10
She 199
now 10
to 805
comprehend 4
that 11
he 965
was 93
the 194
man 343
who 79
in 2721
disposition 3
and 51
would 5
most 3
suit 21
her 182
His 43
understanding 4
and 51
temper 22
though 12
unlike 10
her 182
own 9
would 5
have 11
all 162
her 182
It 67
was 93
an 973
union 14
that 11
must 28
have 11
to 805
the 194
advantage 6
of 111
both 8
by 57
her 182
ease 10
and 51
his 43
mind 25
might 9
have 11
his 43
and 51
his 43
information 3
and 51
knowledge 4
of 111
the 194
world 12
she 199
must 28
have 11
benefit 5
of 111
But 82
no 896
marriage 6
now 10
teach 9
the 194
multitude 3
what 14
was 93
An 973
union 14
of 111
a 6811
different 11
and 51
the 194
of 111
the 194
other 6
was 93
soon 3
to 805
be 1205
in 2721
How 27
and 51
Lydia 5
were 5
to 805
be 1205
in 2721
she 199
not 85
imagine 3
But 82
how 27
little 6
of 111
permanent 4
belong 6
to 805
a 6811
couple 7
who 79
were 5
together 3
were 5
than 22
virtue 3
she 199
conjecture 4
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
soon 3
to 805
his 43
brother 9
To 805
Mr 5

with 34
assurance 3
of 111
his 43
to 805
promote 6
the 194
of 111
any 17
of 111
his 43
and 51
with 34
that 11
the 194
subject 11
might 9
never 3
be 1205
to 805
him 9
The 194
principal 7
purport 6
of 111
his 43
letter 20
was 93
to 805
inform 21
them 9
that 11
Mr 5
had 11
on 86
the 194
militia 6
It 67
was 93
my 90
wish 13
that 11
he 965
should 7
do 815
so 797
he 965
as 510
soon 3
as 510
his 43
marriage 6
was 93
on 86
And 51
I 4332
think 8
you 30
will 40
agree 11
with 34
me 1043
in 2721
the 194
removal 3
that 11
corps 8

It 67

Mr 5

to 805
go 501
into 26
the 194

his 43
former 3
friends 5
there 21

still 13
some 30
who 79
are 12
able 3
and 51
willing 4
to 805
assist 10
him 9
in 2721
the 194
He 965
has 41
the 194
promise 4
of 111
an 973
in 2721
General 22
regiment 9
now 10
in 2721
the 194

is 124
an 973
advantage 6
to 805

it 67
so 797
far 91
this 6
part 102
of 111
the 194
kingdom 3
He 965

I 4332
hope 16

people 4
where 21
they 5
may 49
have 11
a 6811
character 17
to 805
preserve 7
they 5
will 40
both 8
be 1205
more 11
prudent 5
I 4332
have 11
to 805
Colonel 5

to 805
inform 21
him 9
of 111
our 3
present 20
and 51
to 805
request 6
that 11
he 965
will 40
satisfy 3
the 194
of 111
Mr 5

And 51
will 40
you 30

our 3
and 51
all 162

The 194

Nothing 5

with 34
pain 42
and 51
Lydia 5
led 11
to 805
her 182
would 5
not 85
have 11
to 805

think 8
of 111

Good 28

no 896
more 11
idea 21
of 111
being 3
married 3
till 14
I 4332
came 36
back 182
though 12
I 4332
thought 11
it 67
would 5
be 1205
good 28
fun 88
if 8
I 4332
was 93
Her 182
father 12
up 194
his 43
eyes 8
Jane 9
was 93
Elizabeth 5

she 199
who 79
never 3

be 1205
Oh 17

so 797
that 11
he 965

and 51
then 5
I 4332
and 51
like 22
anything 3

no 896
She 199
got 14
up 194
and 51
ran 110

Oh 17

We 446

winter 13
and 51
I 4332
dare 15
say 7
there 21
will 40
be 1205
some 30
balls 7
and 51
I 4332
will 40
take 18
care 47
to 805
get 13
good 28
partners 4
for 487
them 9
all 162
I 4332
should 7
like 22
it 67
anything 3
her 182
mother 21
And 51
then 5
when 6
you 30
go 502
you 30
may 49
leave 14
one 19
or 333
two 14
of 111
my 90
behind 4
you 30
and 51
I 4332
dare 15
say 7
I 4332

get 13

the 194
winter 13
is 124
over 598
I 4332
thank 15
you 30
for 487
my 90
share 22
of 111
the 194
favour 8
Elizabeth 5
but 82
I 4332
do 815
not 85
like 22
your 4
way 27
of 111
were 5
not 85
to 805
remain 9
above 3
ten 151
with 34
them 9
Mr 5
had 11
his 43
commission 10
he 965
left 19
London 5
and 51
he 965
was 93
to 805
join 16
his 43
regiment 9
at 272
the 194
end 96
of 111
a 6811
fortnight 4
No 896
one 19
but 82
Bennet 4
that 11
stay 7
would 5
be 1205
so 797
short 62
and 51
she 199
made 13
the 194
most 3
of 111
the 194
time 45
by 57
with 34
her 182
daughter 5
and 51
frequent 9
at 272
home 90
These 4
were 5
acceptable 3
to 805
all 162
to 805
avoid 8
a 6811
circle 7
was 93
even 36
more 11
desirable 3
to 805
as 510
did 23
think 8
than 22
as 510
did 23
not 85
affection 5
for 487
Lydia 5
was 93
just 24
what 14
Elizabeth 5
had 11
to 805
find 10
it 67
not 85
equal 18
to 805
for 487
him 9
She 199
had 11
her 182
present 20
observation 4
to 805
be 1205
the 194
reason 13
of 111
that 11
elopement 3
had 11
on 86
by 57
the 194
strength 10
of 111
her 182
love 30
than 22
by 57
his 43
and 51
she 199
would 5
have 11
why 4
for 487
her 182
he 965
to 805
elope 6
with 34
her 182
at 272
all 162
had 11
she 199
not 85
felt 5
certain 5
that 11
his 43
flight 9
was 93
by 57
distress 7
of 111
and 51
if 8
that 11
were 5
the 194
case 25
he 965
was 93
not 85
the 194
young 10
man 343
to 805
resist 17
an 973
of 111
a 6811
companion 10
Lydia 5
was 93
fond 17
of 111
him 9
He 965
was 93
her 182
dear 15
on 86
every 10
occasion 7
no 896
one 19
was 93
to 805
be 1205
put 47
in 2721
competition 3
with 34
him 9
He 965
did 23
every 10
thing 15
best 37
in 2721
the 194
world 12
and 51
she 199
was 93
sure 11
he 965
would 5
kill 16
more 11
birds 6
on 86
the 194
first 8
of 111
September 3
than 22
any 17
body 15
in 2721
the 194
country 12
One 19
morning 3
soon 3
after 48
arrival 3
as 510
she 199
was 93
sitting 3
with 34
her 182
two 14
elder 7
she 199
to 805
Elizabeth 5
I 4332
never 3
gave 4
you 30
an 973
account 14
of 111
my 90
wedding 3
I 4332
believe 6
You 30
were 5
not 85
by 57
when 6
I 4332
mamma 9
and 51
the 194
all 162
it 67
Are 12
not 85
you 30
curious 4
to 805
hear 78
how 27
it 67
was 93
No 896
Elizabeth 5
I 4332
think 8
there 21
be 1205
too 50
little 6
on 86
the 194
subject 11
La 979
You 30
are 12
so 797
strange 8
But 82
I 4332
must 28
tell 16
you 30
how 27
it 67
off 102
We 446
were 5
married 3
you 30
know 12
at 272
St 1911
were 5
in 2721
that 11
parish 6
And 51
it 67
was 93
that 11
we 446
should 7
all 162
be 1205
there 21
by 57
eleven 7
My 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
and 51
I 4332
were 5
to 805
go 502
together 3
and 51
the 194
were 5
to 805
meet 9
us 70
at 272
the 194
church 21
Well 24
Monday 3
morning 3
came 36
and 51
I 4332
was 93
in 2721
a 6811
fuss 17
I 4332
was 93
so 797
you 30
know 12
that 11
something 3
would 5
happen 9
to 805
put 47
it 67
off 102
and 51
then 5
I 4332
should 7
have 11
gone 4
And 51
there 21
was 93
my 90
aunt 6
all 162
the 194
time 45
I 4332
was 93
dressing 3
and 51
just 24
as 510
if 8
she 199
was 93
reading 3
a 6811
sermon 7
I 4332
did 23
not 85
hear 78
above 3
one 19
word 26
in 2721
ten 151
for 487
I 4332
was 93
you 30
may 49
suppose 4
of 111
my 90
dear 15
I 4332
to 805
know 12
he 965
would 5
be 1205
married 3
in 2721
his 43
blue 61
coat 12
Well 24
and 51
so 797
we 446
at 272
ten 151
as 510
usual 3
I 4332
thought 11
it 67
would 5
never 3
be 1205
over 598
for 487
by 57
the 194
bye 5
you 30
are 12
to 805
understand 8
that 11
my 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
were 5
unpleasant 4
all 162
the 194
time 45
I 4332
was 93
with 34
them 9
If 8
believe 6
me 1043
I 4332
did 23
not 85
put 47
my 90
foot 79
out 365
of 111
doors 9
though 12
I 4332
was 93
there 21
a 6811
fortnight 4
Not 85
one 19
party 3
or 333
scheme 7
or 333
anything 3
To 805
be 1205
sure 11
London 5
was 93
thin 35
but 82
the 194
Little 6
was 93
open 21
Well 24
and 51
so 797
just 24
as 510
the 195
carriage 5
came 36
to 805
the 195
door 41
my 90
uncle 18
was 93
business 13
to 805
that 11
man 343
Mr 5
Stone 17
And 51
then 5
you 30
know 12
when 6
they 5
get 13
together 3
there 21
is 124
no 896
end 96
of 111
it 67
Well 24
I 4332
was 93
so 797
I 4332
did 23
not 85
know 12
what 14
to 805
do 815
for 487
my 90
uncle 18
was 93
to 805
give 15
me 1043
and 51
if 8
we 446
were 5
the 195
hour 10
we 446
not 85
be 1205
married 3
all 162
day 27
But 82
he 965
came 36
back 182
in 2721
ten 151
time 45
and 51
then 5
we 446
all 162
set 40
out 365
I 4332
that 11
if 8
he 965
had 11
going 3
the 195
wedding 3
need 29
not 85
be 1205
put 47
off 102
for 487
Mr 5
might 9
have 11
done 3
as 510
well 24
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5
in 2721
utter 10
Oh 17
yes 16
he 965
was 93
to 805
come 36
there 21
with 34
you 30
know 12
But 82
gracious 4
me 1043
I 4332
I 4332
not 85
to 805
have 11
a 6811
word 26
it 67
I 4332
them 9
so 797
What 14
will 40
say 7
It 67
was 93
to 805
be 1205
a 6811
secret 25
If 8
it 67
was 93
to 805
be 1205
secret 25
Jane 9
say 7
not 85
word 26
on 86
the 195
subject 11
You 30
may 49
depend 17
my 90
no 896
further 8
Oh 17
Elizabeth 5
though 12
with 34
we 446
will 40
ask 6
you 30
no 896
Thank 15
you 30
Lydia 5
for 487
if 8
you 30
did 23
I 4332
should 7
tell 16
you 30
all 162
and 51
then 5
would 5
be 1205
On 86
encouragement 3
to 805
ask 6
Elizabeth 5
was 93
to 805
put 47
it 67
out 365
of 111
her 182
power 19
by 57
But 82
to 805
live 43
in 2721
on 86
a 6811
point 22
was 93
or 333
at 272
least 3
it 67
was 93
not 85
to 805
try 12
for 487
information 3
Mr 5
had 11
at 272
her 182
wedding 3
It 67
was 93
a 6811
scene 5
and 51
people 4
where 21
he 965
had 11
least 3
to 805
do 815
and 51
least 3
temptation 3
to 805
go 502
as 510
to 805
the 195
meaning 11
of 111
it 67
rapid 10
and 51
wild 36
into 26
her 182
brain 32
but 82
she 199
was 93
with 34
none 32
that 11
best 37
her 182
as 510
his 43
conduct 21
in 2721
the 195
light 42
most 3
She 199
not 85
bear 30
suspense 3
and 51
a 6811
sheet 8
of 111
paper 35
a 6811
short 62
letter 20
to 805
her 182
aunt 6
to 805
request 6
an 973
explanation 3
of 111
what 14
Lydia 5
had 11
if 8
it 67
were 5
compatible 3
with 34
the 195
had 11
intended 3
You 30
may 49
comprehend 4
she 199
what 14
my 90
must 28
be 1205
to 805
know 12

Elizabeth 5
of 111
what 14
Lydia 5
had 11

glad 30
of 111

Chapter 3
Elizabeth 5

the 195
satisfaction 3
of 111
an 973
answer 8
to 805
her 182
letter 20
as 510
soon 3
as 510
she 199
She 199
was 93
no 896

Street 15
Sept 21
My 90
dear 15
Niece 3
I 4332
have 11
just 24
your 4
letter 20
and 51
shall 12
devote 7
this 6
whole 26
morning 3
to 805
it 67
as 510
I 4332
foresee 8
that 11
a 6811
little 6
writing 3
will 40
not 85
comprise 3
what 14
I 4332
have 11
to 805
tell 16
you 30
I 4332
must 28
confess 14
by 57
your 4
application 3
I 4332
did 23
not 85
expect 20
it 67
you 30
think 8
me 1043
for 487
I 4332
mean 36
to 805
let 50
you 30
know 12
that 11
I 4332
had 11
not 85
to 805
be 1205
on 86
your 4
side 74
If 8
you 30
do 815
not 85
choose 5
to 805
understand 8
me 1043
forgive 8
my 90
impertinence 3
Your 4
uncle 18
is 124
as 510
as 510
I 4332
am 394
and 51
nothing 5
but 82
the 195
belief 3
of 111
your 4
being 3
a 6811
party 3
would 5
have 11
him 9
to 805
act 69
as 510
he 965
has 41
done 3
But 82
if 8
you 30
are 12
innocent 4
and 51
I 4332
must 28
be 1205
more 11
explicit 4
On 86
the 195
day 27
of 111
my 90
coming 3
home 90
your 4
uncle 18
had 11
a 6811
most 3
unexpected 4
visitor 3
Mr 5
and 51
was 93
shut 32
up 194
with 34
him 9
several 3
It 67
was 93
all 162
over 598
I 4332
so 797
my 90
was 93
not 85
so 797
as 510
yours 3
to 805
have 11
He 965
came 36
to 805
tell 16
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
that 11
he 965
had 11
found 18
out 365
where 21
your 4
sister 10
and 51
Mr 5
were 5
and 51
that 11
he 965
had 11
and 51
with 34
them 9
both 8
Lydia 5
what 14
I 4332
can 288
collect 30
he 965
left 19
one 19
day 27
after 48
and 51
came 36
to 805
town 27
with 34
the 195
resolution 3
of 111
hunting 4
for 487
them 9
The 195
motive 4
was 93
his 43
conviction 3
of 111
being 3
to 805
that 11
had 11
not 85
so 797
well 24
as 510
to 805
make 17
it 67
for 487
any 17
young 10
woman 21
of 111
character 17
to 805
love 30
or 333
confide 15
in 2721
him 9
He 965
the 195
whole 26
to 805
his 43
pride 6
and 51
that 11
he 965
had 11
thought 11
it 67
him 9
to 805
lay 42
his 43
private 9
open 21
to 805
the 195
world 12
His 43
character 17
was 93
to 805
speak 12
for 487
He 965
it 67
his 43
to 805
step 48
forward 12
and 51
endeavour 4
to 805
remedy 3
an 973
evil 15
had 11
on 86
by 57
If 8
he 965
had 11
motive 4
I 4332
am 394
sure 11
it 67
would 5
never 3
disgrace 8
him 9
He 965
had 11
some 30
in 2721
town 27
he 965
was 93
able 3
to 805
discover 10
them 9
but 82
he 965
had 11
something 3
to 805
direct 30
his 43
search 12
was 93
more 11
than 22
we 446
had 11
and 51
the 195
consciousness 3
of 111
this 6
was 93
reason 13
for 487
his 43
to 805
follow 11
us 70
There 21
is 124
a 6811
lady 18
it 67
a 6811
Younge 3
who 79
was 93
some 30
time 45
ago 15
governess 3
to 805
Miss 72
and 51
was 93
her 182
charge 8
on 86
some 30
cause 14
of 111
though 12
he 965
did 23
not 85
say 7
what 14
She 199
then 5
a 6811
large 11
house 87
in 2721
Edward 7
street 15
and 51
has 41
since 7
by 57
This 6
Younge 3
was 93
he 965
with 34
and 51
he 965
to 805
her 182
for 487
of 111
him 9
as 510
soon 3
as 510
he 965
got 14
to 805
town 27
But 82
it 67
was 93
two 14
or 333
three 12
he 965
get 13
her 182
what 14
he 965
She 199
would 5
not 85
betray 10
her 182
trust 26
I 4332
suppose 4
and 51
corruption 3
for 487
she 199
did 23
know 12
where 21
her 182
friend 15
was 93
to 805
be 1205
found 18
had 11
gone 4
to 805
her 182
on 86
first 8
arrival 3
in 2721
London 5
and 51
had 11
she 199
able 3
to 805
receive 8
them 9
into 26
her 182
house 87
they 5
would 5
have 11
up 194
abode 3
with 34
her 182
At 272
length 14
our 3
kind 31
friend 15
the 195
for 487
direction 5
They 5
were 5
in 2721
street 15
He 965
saw 24
and 51
on 86
Lydia 5
His 43
first 8
object 26
with 34
her 182
he 965
had 11
to 805
persuade 6
her 182
to 805
quit 15
her 182
present 20
disgraceful 4
situation 3
and 51
return 14
to 805
her 182
friends 5
as 510
soon 3
as 510
they 5
be 1205
on 86
to 805
receive 8
her 182
offering 3
his 43
as 510
far 91
as 510
it 67
would 5
go 502
But 82
he 965
found 18
Lydia 5
on 86
where 21
she 199
was 93
She 199
for 487
none 32
of 111
her 182
friends 5
she 199
no 896
help 23
of 111
his 43
she 199
would 5
not 85
hear 78
of 111
leaving 3
She 199
was 93
sure 11
they 5
should 7
be 1205
married 3
some 30
time 45
or 333
other 6
and 51
it 67
did 23
not 85
when 6
Since 7
were 5
her 182
it 67
he 965
thought 11
to 805
secure 6
and 51
expedite 6
a 6811
marriage 6
in 2721
his 43
first 8
conversation 8
with 34
he 965
had 11
never 3
his 43
design 17
He 965
to 805
leave 14
the 195
regiment 9
on 86
account 14
of 111
some 30
of 111
honour 4
were 5
pressing 4
and 51
not 85
to 805
lay 42
all 162
the 195
ill 84
of 111
flight 9
on 86
her 182
own 9
He 965
meant 3
to 805
resign 8
his 43
commission 10
and 51
as 510
to 805
his 43
future 3
situation 3
he 965
conjecture 4
little 6
it 67
He 965
must 28
go 502
but 82
he 965
did 23
not 85
know 12
where 21
and 51
he 965
he 965
should 7
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
live 43
on 86
Mr 5
him 9
why 4
he 965
had 11
not 85
married 3
your 4
sister 10
at 272
Though 12
Mr 5
Bennet 4
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1205
rich 19
he 965
would 5
have 11
able 3
to 805
do 815
something 3
for 487
him 9
and 51
his 43
situation 3
must 28
have 11
by 57
marriage 6
But 82
he 965
found 18
in 2721
reply 3
to 805
this 6
question 16
that 11
still 13
the 195
hope 16
of 111
more 11
making 4
his 43
fortune 8
by 57
marriage 6
in 2721
some 30
other 6
country 12
Under 288
he 965
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1205
proof 11
the 195
temptation 3
of 111
immediate 4
relief 3
They 5
met 181
several 3
times 10
for 487
there 21
was 93
to 805
be 1205
of 111
course 10
more 11
than 22
he 965
get 13
but 82
at 272
length 14
was 93
to 805
be 1205
reasonable 3
being 3
them 9
Mr 5
step 48
was 93
to 805
make 17
your 4
uncle 18
with 34
it 67
and 51
he 965
first 8
in 2721
street 15
the 195
evening 3
I 4332
came 36
home 90
But 82
Mr 5
Gardiner 3
not 85
be 1205
and 51
Mr 5
found 18
on 86
further 8
that 11
your 4
father 12
was 93
still 13
with 34
him 9
but 82
would 5
quit 15
town 27
the 195
morning 3
He 965
did 23
not 85
judge 7
your 4
father 12
to 805
be 1205
a 6811
person 33
whom 3
he 965
so 797
consult 14
as 510
your 4
uncle 18
and 51
him 9
till 14
after 48
the 195
departure 3
of 111
the 195
former 3
He 965
did 23
not 85
leave 14
his 43
name 17
and 51
till 14
the 195
day 27
it 67
was 93
that 11
a 6811
gentleman 4
had 11
on 86
business 13
On 86
Saturday 3
he 965
came 36
Your 4
father 12
was 93
gone 4
your 4
uncle 18
at 272
home 90
and 51
as 510
I 4332
they 5
had 11
a 6811
great 12
deal 13
of 111
talk 18
together 3
They 5
met 181
on 86
Sunday 3
and 51
then 5
I 4332
saw 24
him 9
too 50
It 67
was 93
not 85
all 162
Monday 3
as 510
soon 3
as 510
it 67
was 93
the 195
express 25
was 93
sent 35
off 102
to 805
But 82
our 3
visitor 3
was 93
I 4332
fancy 5
that 11
is 124
the 195
real 48
defect 17
of 111
his 43
character 17
after 48
all 162
He 965
has 41
of 111
at 272
different 11
times 10
but 82
this 6
is 124
the 195
true 9
one 19
Nothing 5
was 93
to 805
be 1205
done 3
that 11
he 965
did 23
not 85
do 815
though 12
I 4332
am 394
sure 11
and 51
I 4332
do 815
not 85
speak 12
it 67
to 805
be 1205
say 7
nothing 5
it 67
your 4
uncle 18
would 5
most 3
have 11
the 195
whole 26
They 5
battled 5
it 67
together 3
for 487
a 6811
long 50
time 45
was 93
more 11
than 22
the 195
gentleman 4
or 333
lady 18
in 2721
it 67
But 82
at 272
last 7
your 4
uncle 18
was 93
to 805
yield 6
and 51
of 111
being 3
to 805
be 1205
of 111
use 18
to 805
his 43
niece 3
was 93
to 805
put 47
up 194
with 34
the 195
probable 3
credit 12
of 111
it 67
the 195
grain 9
and 51
I 4332
believe 6
your 4
letter 20
this 6
morning 3
gave 4
him 9
great 12
pleasure 5
it 67
an 973
explanation 3
that 11
would 5
rob 66
him 9
of 111
his 43
and 51
give 15
the 195
praise 7
where 21
it 67
was 93
due 21
But 82
this 6
must 28
go 502
no 896
than 22
or 333
Jane 9
at 272
most 3
You 30
know 12
pretty 3
well 24
I 4332
suppose 4
what 14
has 41
done 3
for 487
the 195
young 10
people 4
His 43
are 12
to 805
be 1205
I 4332
believe 6
to 805
more 11
than 22
a 6811
thousand 7
thousand 7
in 2721
addition 5
to 805
her 182
own 9
her 182
and 51
his 43
commission 10
The 195
reason 13
why 4
all 162
this 6
was 93
to 805
be 1205
done 3
by 57
him 9
was 93
as 510
I 4332
have 11
given 3
above 3
It 67
was 93
to 805
him 9
to 805
his 43
reserve 7
and 51
want 13
of 111
proper 9
consideration 3
that 11
character 17
had 11
so 797
and 51
that 11
he 965
had 11
and 51
as 510
he 965
was 93
there 21
was 93
some 30
truth 7
in 2721
this 6
though 12
I 4332
doubt 15
his 43
reserve 7
or 333
reserve 7
can 288
be 1205
for 487
the 195
event 18
But 82
in 2721
spite 10
of 111
all 162
this 6
fine 17
my 90
dear 15
you 30
may 49
rest 110
assured 4
that 11
your 4
uncle 18
would 5
never 3
have 11
if 8
we 446
had 11
not 85
given 3
him 9
credit 12
for 487
interest 6
in 2721
the 195
affair 3
When 6
all 162
this 6
was 93
on 86
he 965
to 805
his 43
friends 5
who 79
were 5
still 13
at 272
but 82
it 67
was 93
that 11
he 965
should 7
be 1205
in 2721
London 5
more 11
when 6
the 195
wedding 3
place 29
and 51
all 162
money 17
were 5
then 5
to 805
receive 8
the 195
last 7
finish 8
I 4332
believe 6
I 4332
have 11
now 10
you 30
every 10
thing 15
It 67
is 124
a 6811
relation 8
you 30
tell 16
me 1043
is 124

bore 13
the 195
share 22
The 195
vague 6

Mr 5

had 11
to 805
encourage 6
as 510
an 973
exertion 3
of 111
too 50
great 12
to 805

a 6811
research 8
in 2721
supplication 3
had 11
to 805
a 6811
woman 21
whom 3
he 965
must 28
abominate 3
and 51
despise 3
and 51
where 21
he 965
was 93
to 805
meet 9
meet 9

the 195
man 343
whom 3
he 965
most 3
to 805
avoid 8
and 51
name 17
it 67
was 93
punishment 3
to 805
him 9
to 805
pronounce 7
He 965
had 11
done 3
all 162
this 6
for 487
a 6811
girl 14
whom 3
he 965
regard 7
nor 102

Her 182
heart 59
did 23
whisper 8
that 11
he 965
had 11
done 3
it 67
for 487
her 182
But 82
it 67
was 93
a 6811
hope 16
by 57
other 6
and 51
she 199
soon 3
felt 5
that 11
even 36
her 182
was 93
when 6
to 805
depend 17
on 86
his 43
affection 5
for 487
her 182
for 487
a 6811
woman 21
who 79
had 11
him 9
as 510
able 3
to 805

sentiment 18
so 797
natural 18
as 510
relationship 3

Brother 9

of 111
Every 10

He 965
had 11
to 805
be 1205
sure 11
done 3
She 199
was 93
to 805
think 8
how 27
But 82
he 965
had 11
given 3
a 6811
reason 13
for 487
his 43
no 896
stretch 15
of 111
belief 3
It 67
was 93
reasonable 3
that 11
he 965
should 7
feel 11
he 965
had 11
wrong 24
he 965
had 11
and 51
he 965
had 11
the 195
of 111
it 67
and 51
though 12
she 199
would 5
not 85
place 29
as 510
his 43
principal 7
inducement 3
she 199
believe 6
that 11
for 487
her 182
might 9
assist 10
his 43
in 2721
a 6811
cause 14
where 21
her 182
peace 21
of 111
mind 25
must 28
be 1205
It 67
was 93
painful 6
painful 6
to 805
know 12
that 11
they 5
were 5
under 288
to 805
a 6811
person 33
who 79
never 3
receive 8
a 6811
return 14
They 5
the 195
restoration 3
of 111

her 182
character 17
every 10
thing 15
to 805
him 9
Oh 17
how 27
did 23
she 199
grieve 6
over 598
every 10
sensation 14
she 199
had 11
ever 33
every 10
speech 13
she 199
had 11
ever 33
him 9
For 487
she 199
was 93
but 82
she 199
was 93
proud 5
of 111
him 9
Proud 5
that 11
in 2721
a 6811
cause 14
of 111
compassion 4
and 51
honour 4
he 965
had 11
able 3
to 805
get 13
the 195
better 7
of 111
She 199
read 49
over 598
her 182
commendation 3
of 111
him 9
and 51
It 67
was 93
but 82
it 67
her 182
She 199
was 93
even 36
sensible 3
of 111
some 30
pleasure 5
though 12
with 34
regret 9
on 86
finding 4
how 27
both 8
she 199
and 51
her 182
uncle 18
had 11
that 11
affection 5
and 51
confidence 3
Mr 5
and 51
She 199
was 93
her 182
seat 12
and 51
her 182
by 57
some 30
approach 6
and 51
she 199
strike 14
into 26
path 25
she 199
was 93
by 57
I 4332
am 394
I 4332
interrupt 11
your 4

my 90
dear 15
sister 10
he 965
as 510
he 965
her 182
You 30
do 815
she 199
with 34
a 6811
smile 7
but 82
it 67
does 5
not 85
follow 11
that 11
the 195
interruption 3
must 28
be 1205
I 4332
should 7
be 1205
if 8
it 67
were 5
We 446
were 5
good 28
friends 5
and 51
now 10
we 446
are 12
better 7
True 9
Are 12
the 195

And 51
so 797
my 90
dear 15

I 4332
find 10
our 3
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
that 11
you 30
have 11
She 199
in 2721
the 195
affirmative 4
I 4332
envy 4
you 30
the 195
pleasure 5
and 51
yet 4
I 4332
believe 6
it 67
would 5
be 1205
too 50
for 487
me 1043
or 333
I 4332
take 18
it 67
in 2721
my 90
way 27
to 805
And 51
you 30
saw 24
the 195
old 21
housekeeper 3
I 4332
suppose 4
Poor 11
she 199
was 93
fond 17
of 111
me 1043
But 82
of 111
course 10
she 199
did 23
not 85
mention 5
my 90
name 17
to 805
you 30
Yes 16

did 23
And 51
what 14

say 7
That 11

At 272

see 70
in 2721
town 27
last 7
month 7
We 446
other 6
several 3
times 10
I 4332
wonder 17
what 14
he 965
can 288
be 1205
doing 3
there 21
for 487
his 43
marriage 6
with 34
Miss 72
de 2457
Elizabeth 5
It 67
must 28
be 1205
something 3
particular 13
to 805
take 18
him 9
there 21
at 272
this 6
time 45
of 111
year 20
Did 23
you 30
see 70
him 9
while 4

Yes 16

I 4332
have 11
that 11
she 199

this 6
year 20
or 333
two 14
When 6
I 4332
last 7
saw 24
her 182
she 199
was 93
not 85
I 4332
am 394
glad 30
you 30
her 182
I 4332
hope 16
she 199
will 40
turn 46
out 365
well 24
I 4332
dare 15
say 7
she 199
will 40
she 199
has 41
got 14
over 598
the 195
most 3
age 24
Did 23
you 30
go 502
by 57
the 195
village 6
of 111
I 4332
do 815
not 85
recollect 7
that 11
we 446

I 4332
mention 5
it 67
it 67

to 805
have 11
had 11
A 6811

place 29
Parsonage 3
House 87

in 2721
every 10
respect 18
How 27
should 7
you 30
have 11
making 4
well 24
I 4332
should 7
have 11
it 67
as 510
part 102
of 111
my 90
and 51
the 195
exertion 3
would 5
soon 3
have 11
nothing 5
One 19
not 85
to 805
repine 3
but 82
to 805
be 1205
sure 11
it 67
would 5
have 11
a 6811
thing 15
for 487
me 1043
The 195
quiet 20
the 195
retirement 3
of 111
a 6811
life 44
would 5
have 11
all 162
my 90
of 111
But 82
it 67
was 93
not 85

you 30
may 49
remember 4
I 4332

that 11
there 21
was 93
a 6811
time 45
when 6

You 30

had 11
fast 29
to 805
get 13
rid 42
of 111
him 9
and 51
unwilling 4
for 487
her 182
sake 3
to 805

in 2721
reply 3
with 34
a 6811
good 28
smile 7

As 510

But 82
you 30

married 3
women 6
have 11
never 3
time 45
for 487
writing 3
My 90

write 5
to 805

They 5
will 40
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
do 815
Mr 5

He 965
handsome 6
and 51
pretty 3
He 965

a 6811
fellow 9
Mr 5
Bennet 4
as 510

William 4
Lucas 3
to 805
produce 7
a 6811
more 11
valuable 3
son 70
in 2721
law 45
The 195
loss 3
of 111
her 182
daughter 5
made 13
Bennet 4
dull 13
for 487
several 3
I 4332
often 4
think 8
she 199
that 11
there 21
is 124
nothing 5
so 797
bad 33
as 510
parting 3
with 34
friends 5
One 19
so 797
them 9
This 6
is 124
the 195
consequence 3
you 30
see 70
Madam 5
of 111
a 6811
daughter 5
Elizabeth 5
It 67
must 28
make 17
you 30
better 7
that 11
your 4
other 6
four 26
are 12
single 15
It 67
is 124
no 896
thing 15
Lydia 5
does 5
not 85
leave 14
me 1043
she 199
is 124
married 3
but 82
her 182
regiment 9
happens 4
to 805
be 1205
so 797
far 91
off 102
If 8
that 11
had 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
have 11
gone 4
so 797
soon 3
But 82
the 195
condition 13
this 6
event 18
her 182
into 26
was 93
and 51
her 182
mind 25
to 805
the 195
agitation 3
of 111
hope 16
by 57
an 973
article 4
of 111

then 5

The 195

for 487
the 195
arrival 3
of 111

Well 24

Not 85

you 30

and 51
I 4332
am 394

I 4332

But 82
he 965

And 51

You 30

long 50
ago 15
never 3
to 805

And 51
so 797
is 124
it 67
certain 5
he 965
is 124
coming 3
You 30
may 49
depend 17
on 86
it 67
the 195
other 6
for 487

in 2721
last 7
night 61
I 4332

out 365
on 86
purpose 12
to 805
know 12
the 195
truth 7
of 111
it 67
and 51
she 199
me 1043
that 11
it 67
was 93
certain 5
true 9
He 965

Thursday 3
at 272

She 199

to 805
order 11
in 2721
some 30
meat 17

got 14
three 12
couple 7
of 111
just 24
fit 30
to 805
be 1205
Miss 72
Bennet 4
had 11
not 85
able 3
to 805
hear 78
of 111
his 43
coming 3
colour 3
It 67
was 93
since 7
she 199
had 11
his 43
name 17
to 805
Elizabeth 5
but 82
now 10
as 510
soon 3
as 510
they 5
were 5
together 3
she 199
I 4332
saw 24
you 30
look 14
at 272
me 1043
to 805
day 27
when 6
my 90
aunt 6
us 70
of 111
the 195
present 20
report 12
and 51
I 4332
know 12
I 4332
But 82
imagine 3
it 67
was 93
any 17
cause 14
I 4332
was 93
for 487
the 195
moment 15
I 4332
felt 5
that 11
I 4332
should 7
be 1205
at 272
I 4332
do 815
assure 6
you 30
that 11
the 195
news 71
does 5
not 85
affect 15
me 1043
with 34
pleasure 5
or 333
pain 42
I 4332
am 394
glad 30
of 111
one 19
thing 15
that 11
he 965
comes 4
we 446
shall 12
see 70
the 195
less 19
of 111
him 9
Not 85
that 11
I 4332
am 394
of 111
but 82
I 4332
dread 14
other 6
Elizabeth 5
did 23
not 85
know 12
what 14
to 805
make 17
of 111
it 67
Had 11
she 199
not 85
him 9
in 2721
she 199
might 9
have 11
him 9
of 111
coming 3
there 21
with 34
no 896
other 6
view 18
than 22
what 14
was 93
but 82
she 199
still 13
thought 11
him 9
partial 6
to 805
Jane 9
and 51
she 199
as 510
to 805
the 195
of 111
his 43
coming 3
there 21
with 34
his 43
permission 3
or 333
being 3
bold 9
to 805
come 36
it 67
Yet 4
it 67
is 124
hard 70
she 199
thought 11
that 11
this 6
poor 11
man 343
come 36
to 805
a 6811
house 87
he 965
has 41
all 162
this 6
speculation 3
I 4332
will 40
leave 14
him 9
to 805
In 2721
spite 10
of 111
what 14
her 182
sister 10
and 51
to 805
be 1205
her 182
in 2721
the 195
expectation 3
of 111
his 43
arrival 3
Elizabeth 5
perceive 3
that 11
her 182
were 5
by 57
it 67
They 5
were 5
more 11
more 11
unequal 3
than 22
she 199
had 11
often 4
them 9
The 195
subject 11
had 11
so 797
a 6811
twelvemonth 3
ago 15
was 93
now 10
forward 12
As 510
soon 3
as 510
ever 33
Mr 5
Bingley 4
comes 4
my 90
dear 15
Bennet 4
you 30
will 40
wait 19
on 86
him 9
of 111
course 10
No 896
no 896
You 30

into 26
him 9
last 7
year 20
and 51
if 8
I 4332
to 805
see 70
him 9
he 965
should 7
one 19
of 111
my 90
But 82
it 67
in 2721
nothing 5
and 51
I 4332
will 40
not 85
be 1205
sent 35
on 86
a 6811
errand 3
His 43
wife 6
to 805
him 9
how 27
an 973
attention 3
would 5
be 1205
all 162
the 195
on 86
his 43
to 805
an 973
I 4332
despise 3
he 965
If 8
he 965
our 3
let 50
him 9
seek 6
it 67
He 965
where 21
we 446
live 43
I 4332
will 40
not 85
spend 11
my 90
in 2721
after 48
my 90
every 10
time 45
they 5
go 502
and 51
come 36
back 182
Well 24
all 162
I 4332
know 12
is 124
that 11
it 67
will 40
be 1205
rude 6
if 8
you 30
do 815
not 85
wait 19
on 86
him 9
But 82
that 11
prevent 13
my 90
him 9
to 805
dine 9
here 31
I 4332
am 394
We 446
must 28
have 11
Long 50
and 51
the 195
soon 3
That 11
will 40
make 17
thirteen 6
with 34
so 797
there 21
will 40
be 1205
just 24
room 22
at 272
table 27
for 487
him 9
by 57
this 6
resolution 3
she 199
was 93
the 195
better 7
able 3
to 805
bear 30
her 182
though 12
it 67
was 93
to 805
know 12
that 11
her 182
might 9
all 162
see 70
Mr 5
Bingley 4
in 2721
consequence 3
of 111
it 67
they 5
did 23
As 510
the 195
day 27
of 111
his 43
arrival 3
near 15
I 4332
begin 8
to 805
be 1205
that 11
he 965
comes 4
at 272
all 162
Jane 9
to 805
her 182
sister 10
It 67
would 5
be 1205
nothing 5
I 4332
see 70

with 34
perfect 24
but 82
I 4332
can 288
bear 30
to 805
hear 78

of 111
My 90

but 82
she 199

can 288
know 12
how 27
I 4332
suffer 11
what 14
she 199
shall 12
I 4332
be 1205
when 6
his 43

I 4332
wish 13
I 4332

You 30

satisfaction 3
of 111

the 195
of 111
it 67
that 11
the 195
period 16
of 111

But 82

There 21

it 67
be 1205
Some 30
acquaintance 5
or 333
other 6
my 90

I 4332

I 4332

La 979

That 11

Good 28

Well 24

Mr 5
will 40
be 1205
welcome 4
here 31
to 805
be 1205
sure 11
but 82
I 4332
must 28
say 7
that 11
I 4332
hate 14
the 195
sight 17
of 111
him 9
Jane 9
at 272
Elizabeth 5
with 34
surprise 4
and 51
concern 6
She 199

and 51
felt 5
for 487
the 195
must 28
attend 15
her 182
sister 10
in 2721
him 9
for 487
the 195
first 8
time 45
after 48
his 43
letter 20
Both 8
were 5
felt 5
for 487
the 195
other 6
and 51
of 111
course 10
for 487
and 51
mother 21
on 86
of 111
her 182
dislike 4
of 111
Mr 5
and 51
her 182
resolution 3
to 805
be 1205
civil 15
to 805
him 9
as 510
Mr 5
friend 15
being 3
by 57
of 111
them 9
But 82
Elizabeth 5
had 11
of 111
not 85
be 1205
by 57
Jane 9
to 805
whom 3
she 199
had 11
never 3
yet 4
had 11
courage 6
to 805
shew 5
letter 20
or 333
to 805
relate 8
her 182
own 9
change 21
of 111
sentiment 18
him 9
To 805
Jane 9
he 965
be 1205
a 6811
man 343
she 199
had 11
and 51
merit 13
she 199
had 11
but 82
to 805
her 182
own 9
more 11
extensive 4
information 3
he 965
was 93
the 195
person 33
to 805
whom 3
the 195
whole 26
were 5
indebted 3
for 487
the 195
first 8
of 111
and 51
whom 3
she 199
with 34
an 973
interest 6
if 8
not 85
so 797
tender 27
at 272
least 3
as 510
reasonable 3
and 51
just 24
as 510
what 14
Jane 9
felt 5
for 487
Bingley 4
Her 182
at 272
his 43
coming 3
at 272
his 43
coming 3
to 805
to 805
and 51
her 182
was 93
equal 18
to 805
what 14
she 199
had 11
on 86
first 8
his 43
in 2721
The 195
colour 3
had 11
her 182
face 19
for 487
half 23
a 6811
minute 13
with 34
an 973
glow 14
and 51
a 6811
smile 7
of 111
delight 8
to 805
her 182
eyes 8
as 510
she 199
thought 11
for 487
that 11
space 34
of 111
time 45
that 11
his 43
affection 5
and 51
must 28
still 13
be 1205
But 82
she 199
would 5
not 85
be 1205
secure 6
Let 50
me 1043
first 8
see 70
how 27
he 965
she 199
it 67
will 40
then 5
be 1205
for 487
expectation 3
She 199
sat 92
at 272
work 87
to 805
be 1205
and 51
daring 3
to 805
lift 11
up 194
her 182
eyes 8
till 14
anxious 4
them 9
to 805
the 195
face 19
of 111

than 22

but 82
more 11
sedate 8
than 22
Elizabeth 5
had 11
On 86
the 195

with 34
ease 10
and 51
with 34
a 6811

or 333
any 17
Elizabeth 5
as 510
little 6
to 805
as 510
would 5
allow 9
and 51
sat 92
down 90
to 805
her 182
work 87
with 34
an 973
it 67
did 23
not 85
often 4
command 21
She 199
had 11
one 19
glance 4
at 272
He 965
serious 4
as 510
usual 3
and 51
she 199
thought 11
more 11
as 510
he 965
had 11
to 805
look 14
in 2721
than 22
as 510
she 199
had 11
him 9
at 272
But 82
he 965
not 85
in 2721
her 182
presence 3
be 1205
what 14
he 965
was 93
her 182
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
It 67
was 93
a 6811
painful 6
but 82
not 85
an 973
conjecture 4
Bingley 4
she 199
had 11
for 487
an 973
instant 11
and 51
in 2721
that 11
short 62
period 16
saw 24
him 9
both 8
and 51
He 965
was 93
by 57
Bennet 4
with 34
a 6811
degree 3
of 111
made 13
her 182
two 14
when 6
with 34
the 195
cold 9
and 51
ceremonious 4
of 111
her 182
and 51
address 9
to 805
his 43
friend 15
Elizabeth 5
who 79
that 11
her 182
mother 21
to 805
the 195
latter 3
the 195
preservation 5
of 111
her 182
favourite 3
daughter 5
was 93
hurt 12
and 51
to 805
a 6811
most 3
painful 6
degree 3
by 57
a 6811
distinction 3
so 797
ill 84
after 48
of 111
her 182
how 27
Mr 5
and 51
Gardiner 3
did 23
a 6811
question 16
she 199
not 85
answer 8
confusion 3
anything 3
He 965
was 93
not 85
by 57
her 182
that 11
was 93
the 195
reason 13
of 111
his 43
silence 7
but 82
it 67
had 11
not 85
so 797
in 2721
There 21
he 965
had 11
to 805
her 182
friends 5
when 6
he 965
not 85
to 805
But 82
now 10
several 3
minutes 3
the 195
sound 29
of 111
his 43
voice 8
and 51
when 6
to 805
resist 17
the 195
impulse 4
of 111
she 199
her 182
eyes 8
to 805
his 43
face 19
she 199
as 510
often 4
found 18
him 9
at 272
Jane 9
as 510
at 272
and 51
on 86
no 896
object 26
but 82
the 195
ground 36
More 11
and 51
less 19
to 805
please 3
than 22
when 6
they 5
last 7
met 181
were 5
She 199
was 93
and 51
with 34
for 487
being 3
so 797
I 4332
expect 20
it 67
to 805
be 1205
she 199
Yet 4
why 4
did 23
he 965
come 36
She 199
was 93
in 2721
no 896
for 487
conversation 8
with 34
but 82
and 51
to 805
him 9
she 199
had 11
courage 6
to 805
speak 12
She 199
after 48
his 43
sister 10
but 82
do 815
no 896
more 11
It 67
is 124
a 6811
long 50
time 45
Mr 5
Bingley 4
since 7
you 30
Bennet 4
He 965
to 805
it 67
I 4332
to 805
be 1205
you 30
would 5
never 3
come 36
back 182
People 4
did 23
say 7
you 30
meant 3
to 805
quit 15
the 195
place 29
at 272
Michaelmas 3
but 82
I 4332
hope 16
it 67
is 124
not 85
true 9
A 6811
great 12
have 11
in 2721
the 195
since 7
you 30
Miss 72
Lucas 3
is 124
married 3
and 51
And 51
one 19
of 111
my 90
own 9
I 4332
suppose 4
you 30
have 11
of 111
it 67
you 30
must 28
have 11
it 67
in 2721
the 195
It 67
was 93
in 2721
The 195
Times 10
and 51
The 195
Courier 5
I 4332
know 12
though 12
it 67
was 93
not 85
put 47
in 2721
as 510
it 67
to 805
be 1205
It 67
was 93
George 6
Esq 5

Miss 72
Lydia 5
Bennet 4
' 14
there 21
being 3
a 6811
syllable 3
of 111
her 182
father 12
or 333
the 195
place 29
where 21
she 199
or 333
anything 3
It 67
was 93
my 90
brother 9
drawing 3
up 194
too 50
and 51
I 4332
wonder 17
how 27
he 965
came 36
to 805
make 17
an 973
awkward 6
business 13
of 111
it 67
Did 23
you 30
see 70
it 67
Bingley 4
that 11
he 965
did 23
and 51
made 13
his 43
Elizabeth 5
dared 6
not 85
lift 11
up 194
her 182
eyes 8
How 27
Mr 5
she 199
not 85
tell 16
It 67
is 124
a 6811
thing 15
to 805
be 1205
sure 11
to 805
have 11
a 6811
daughter 5
well 24
married 3
her 182
mother 21
but 82
at 272
the 195
same 5
time 45
Mr 5
Bingley 4
it 67
is 124
hard 70
to 805
have 11
her 182
a 6811
way 27
me 1043
They 5
are 12
gone 4
down 90
to 805
a 6811
place 29
it 67
and 51
there 21
they 5
are 12
to 805
stay 7
I 4332
do 815
not 85
know 12
how 27
long 50
His 43
regiment 9
is 124
there 21
for 487
I 4332
suppose 4
you 30
have 11
of 111
his 43
leaving 3
the 195
shire 3
and 51
of 111
his 43
being 3
gone 4
into 26
the 195
Thank 15
Heaven 9
he 965
has 41
some 30
friends 5
though 12
not 85
so 797
as 510
he 965
Elizabeth 5
who 79
this 6
to 805
be 1205
at 272
Mr 5
was 93
in 2721
of 111
shame 14
that 11
she 199
keep 11
her 182
seat 12
It 67
her 182
the 195
exertion 3
of 111
nothing 5
had 11
so 797
done 3
and 51
she 199
Bingley 4
he 965
meant 3
to 805
make 17
any 17
stay 7
in 2721
the 195
country 12
at 272
present 20
A 6811
few 6
he 965
When 6
you 30
have 11
all 162
your 4
own 9
birds 6
Mr 5
Bingley 4
her 182
mother 21
I 4332
beg 59
you 30
will 40
come 36
here 31
and 51
shoot 12
as 510
as 510
you 30
please 3
on 86
Mr 5
manor 4
I 4332
am 394
sure 11
he 965
will 40
be 1205
to 805
oblige 3
you 30
and 51
will 40
save 7
all 162
the 195
best 37
of 111
the 195
for 487
you 30
at 272
officious 4
attention 3
Were 5
the 195
same 5
fair 25
prospect 13
to 805
arise 3
at 272
present 20
as 510
had 11
them 9
a 6811
year 20
ago 15
every 10
thing 15
she 199
was 93
would 5
be 1205
to 805
the 195
same 5
conclusion 3
At 272
that 11
instant 11
she 199
felt 5
that 11
of 111
not 85
make 17
Jane 9
or 333
for 487
of 111
painful 6
confusion 3
The 195
first 8
wish 13
of 111
my 90
heart 59
she 199
to 805
is 124
never 3
more 11
to 805
be 1205
in 2721
with 34
of 111
them 9
can 288
afford 6
no 896
pleasure 5
that 11
will 40
atone 5
for 487
as 510
this 6
Let 50
me 1043
never 3
see 70
one 19
or 333
the 195
other 6
Yet 4
the 195
for 487
of 111
were 5
to 805
offer 10
no 896
compensation 3
soon 3
material 17
relief 3
how 27
the 195
of 111
her 182
sister 10
re 3838
the 195
of 111
her 182
former 3
lover 3
When 6
first 8
he 965
came 36
in 2721
he 965
had 11
to 805
her 182
but 82
little 6
but 82
every 10
five 5
minutes 3
to 805
be 1205
her 182
more 11
of 111
his 43
attention 3
He 965
found 18
her 182
as 510
handsome 6
as 510
she 199
had 11
last 7
year 20
as 510
good 28
and 51
as 510
though 12
not 85
so 797
Jane 9
was 93
anxious 4
that 11
no 896
difference 3
should 7
be 1205
in 2721
her 182
at 272
all 162
and 51
was 93
that 11
she 199
as 510
as 510
ever 33
But 82
her 182
mind 25
was 93
so 797
that 11
she 199
did 23
not 85
know 12
when 6
she 199
was 93
silent 6
When 6
the 195
rose 37
to 805
go 502
Bennet 4
was 93
mindful 4
of 111
her 182
intended 3
and 51
they 5
were 5
and 51
to 805
dine 9
at 272
in 2721
a 6811
few 6
time 45
You 30
are 12
a 6811
visit 14
in 2721
my 90
debt 6
Mr 5
Bingley 4
she 199
for 487
when 6
you 30
to 805
town 27
last 7
winter 13
you 30
to 805
take 18
a 6811
dinner 9
with 34
us 70
as 510
soon 3
as 510
you 30
I 4332
have 11
not 85
you 30
see 70
and 51
I 4332
assure 6
you 30
I 4332
was 93
that 11
you 30
did 23
not 85
come 36
back 182
and 51
keep 11
your 4
engagement 3
Bingley 4
a 6811
little 6
at 272
this 6
reflection 3
and 51
something 3
of 111
his 43
concern 6
at 272
by 57
business 13
They 5
then 5
Bennet 4
had 11
to 805
ask 6
them 9
to 805
stay 7
and 51
dine 9
there 21
that 11
day 27
but 82
though 12
she 199
a 6811
good 28
table 27
she 199
did 23
not 85
think 8
anything 3
less 19
than 22
two 14
be 1205
good 28
for 487
a 6811
man 343
on 86
whom 3
she 199
had 11
anxious 4
or 333
satisfy 3
the 195
appetite 3
and 51
pride 6
of 111
one 19
who 79
had 11
ten 151
thousand 7
a 6811
year 20
Chapter 3
As 510
soon 3
as 510
they 5
were 5
gone 4
Elizabeth 5
out 365
to 805
recover 8
her 182
or 333
in 2721
other 6
words 5
to 805
dwell 8
interruption 3
on 86
that 11
must 28
deaden 4
them 9
more 11
Mr 5
and 51
her 182
Why 4
if 8
he 965
came 36
to 805
be 1205
silent 6
grave 28
and 51
she 199
did 23
he 965
come 36
at 272
all 162
She 199
settle 10
it 67
in 2721
no 896
way 27
that 11
gave 4
her 182
pleasure 5
He 965
be 1205
still 13
still 13
pleasing 3
to 805
my 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
when 6
he 965
was 93
in 2721
town 27
and 51
why 4
not 85
to 805
me 1043
If 8
he 965
me 1043
why 4
come 36
If 8
he 965
no 896
cares 6
for 487
me 1043
why 4
silent 6
man 343
I 4332
will 40
think 8
no 896
more 11
him 9
Her 182
resolution 3
was 93
for 487
a 6811
short 62
time 45
by 57
the 195
approach 6
of 111
her 182
sister 10
who 79
her 182
with 34
a 6811
cheerful 6
look 14
her 182
better 7
with 34
than 22
Elizabeth 5
Now 10
she 199
that 11
this 6
first 8
meeting 6
is 124
over 598
I 4332
feel 11
I 4332
know 12
my 90
own 9
strength 10
and 51
I 4332
shall 12
never 3
be 1205
by 57
his 43
coming 3
I 4332
am 394
glad 30
he 965
here 31
on 86
Tuesday 3
It 67
will 40
then 5
be 1205
that 11
on 86
both 8
sides 23

meet 9
as 510
common 23
and 51
acquaintance 5
Yes 16
Elizabeth 5
Oh 17
Jane 9
take 18
care 47
My 90
dear 15
you 30
think 8
me 1043
so 797
weak 20
as 510
to 805
be 1205
in 2721
danger 7
now 10
I 4332
think 8
you 30
are 12
in 2721
great 12
danger 7
of 111
making 4
him 9
as 510
in 2721
love 30
with 34
you 30
as 510
ever 33
They 5

On 86

When 6

On 86

He 965

that 11
Bingley 4
had 11
his 43

she 199
not 85

Mr 5

an 973

His 43

Her 182

the 195
sense 8
of 111
what 14
they 5
him 9
more 11
painful 6
to 805

she 199
would 5
at 272
times 10
have 11
given 3
anything 3
to 805
be 1205
to 805
tell 16
him 9
that 11

the 195
whole 26

the 195
She 199
was 93
in 2721
that 11
the 195

afford 6
some 30
of 111
them 9
together 3
that 11
the 195
whole 26

her 182
uncivil 3
She 199
forward 12

as 510
the 195
point 22
on 86
all 162
her 182
chance 20
of 111

on 86
to 805
the 195

she 199
saw 24
to 805
her 182
infinite 7
surprise 4
there 21
was 93
reason 13
to 805
fear 14
that 11

other 6
would 5
have 11
it 67
all 162
situation 3
was 93
awkward 6
but 82
hers 9
she 199
thought 11
was 93
still 13
worse 6
Not 85
a 6811
syllable 3
was 93

Elizabeth 5
was 93
on 86
the 195

Bingley 4
who 79
as 510
well 24
as 510
the 195

had 11
sat 92
down 90

ran 110
out 365
of 111
the 195

Jane 9
have 11
no 896
Elizabeth 5
where 21
confidence 3
would 5
give 15
pleasure 5
and 51
her 182
with 34
the 195
emotion 12
that 11
she 199
was 93
the 195
creature 3
in 2721
the 195
world 12
too 50
she 199
by 57
far 91
too 50
I 4332
do 815
not 85
deserve 4
it 67
Oh 17
why 4
is 124
not 85
as 510
were 5
given 3
with 34
a 6811
a 6811
a 6811
delight 8
words 5
but 82
express 25
Every 10
sentence 4
of 111
kindness 3
was 93
a 6811
fresh 22
source 4
of 111
to 805
Jane 9
But 82
she 199
would 5
not 85
allow 9
to 805
stay 7
with 34
her 182
sister 10
or 333
say 7
half 23
that 11
to 805
be 1205
for 487
the 195
present 20
I 4332
must 28
go 502
to 805
my 90
mother 21
she 199
I 4332
would 5
not 85
on 86
any 17
account 14
trifle 7
with 34
her 182
or 333
allow 9
her 182
to 805
hear 78
it 67
but 82
He 965

to 805
my 90

Oh 17

pleasure 5
to 805
all 162
my 90

She 199
then 5
to 805
her 182

so 797
of 111
suspense 3

vexation 3
And 51

of 111
all 162
his 43
anxious 4
of 111
all 162
his 43
falsehood 3
and 51
contrivance 3
the 195
most 3
reasonable 3

In 2721

He 965

Then 5
her 182

Oh 17

I 4332
get 13
a 6811
wink 13
of 111
sleep 33
all 162
night 61
I 4332
how 27
it 67
would 5
be 1205
I 4332
it 67
must 28
be 1205
so 797
at 272
last 7
I 4332
was 93
sure 11
you 30
not 85
be 1205
so 797
for 487
nothing 5
I 4332
remember 4
as 510
soon 3
as 510
ever 33
I 4332
saw 24
him 9
when 6
he 965
first 8
came 36
into 26
last 7
year 20
I 4332
thought 11
how 27
it 67
was 93
that 11
you 30
should 7
come 36
together 3
Oh 17
he 965
is 124
the 195
young 10
man 343
that 11
ever 33
was 93
Lydia 5
were 5
all 162
Jane 9
was 93
competition 3
her 182
favourite 3
child 28
At 272
that 11
moment 15
she 199
for 487
no 896
other 6
Her 182
soon 3
to 805
make 17
interest 6
with 34
her 182
for 487
of 111
she 199
might 9
in 2721
future 3
be 1205
able 3
to 805
dispense 6
Mary 13
for 487
the 195
use 18
of 111
the 195
at 272
and 51
hard 70
for 487
a 6811
few 6
balls 7
there 21
every 10
winter 13
Bingley 4
this 6
time 45
was 93
of 111
course 10
a 6811
visitor 3
at 272
coming 3
breakfast 5
and 51
till 14
after 48
supper 4
when 6
some 30
neighbour 6
who 79
not 85
be 1205
had 11
given 3
him 9
an 973
invitation 6
to 805
dinner 9
he 965
thought 11
to 805
accept 16
Elizabeth 5
had 11
now 10
but 82
little 6
time 45
for 487
conversation 8
with 34
her 182
sister 10
for 487
while 4
he 965
was 93
present 20
Jane 9
had 11
no 896
attention 3
to 805
bestow 7
on 86
but 82
she 199
found 18
useful 4
to 805
both 8
of 111
them 9
in 2721
of 111
separation 3
that 11
must 28
occur 7
In 2721
the 195
absence 3
of 111
Jane 9
he 965
to 805
Elizabeth 5
for 487
the 195
pleasure 5
of 111
of 111
her 182
and 51
when 6
Bingley 4
was 93
gone 4
Jane 9
the 195
same 5
of 111
relief 3
He 965
has 41
made 13
me 1043
so 797
she 199
one 19
evening 3
by 57
me 1043
that 11
he 965
was 93
of 111
my 90
being 3
in 2721
town 27
last 7
spring 23
I 4332
had 11
not 85
it 67
possible 3
I 4332
as 510
Elizabeth 5
But 82
how 27
did 23
he 965
account 14
for 487
it 67
It 67
must 28
have 11
his 43
doing 3
They 5
were 5
no 896
friends 5
to 805
his 43
acquaintance 5
with 34
me 1043
I 4332
wonder 17
at 272
since 7
he 965
might 9
have 11
so 797
more 11
in 2721
But 82
when 6
they 5
see 70
as 510
I 4332
trust 26
they 5
will 40
that 11
brother 9
is 124
with 34
me 1043
they 5
will 40
learn 10
to 805
be 1205
contented 4
and 51
we 446
shall 12
be 1205
on 86
good 28
though 12
we 446
can 288
never 3
be 1205
what 14
we 446
were 5
to 805
other 6
That 11
is 124
the 195
most 3
speech 13
Elizabeth 5
that 11
I 4332
ever 33
you 30
utter 10
Good 28
girl 14
It 67
would 5
vex 9
me 1043
to 805
see 70
you 30
the 195
dupe 7
of 111
Miss 72
regard 7
Would 5
you 30
believe 6
it 67
that 11
when 6
he 965
to 805
town 27
last 7
November 3
he 965
me 1043
and 51
nothing 5
but 82
a 6811
persuasion 3
of 111
my 90
being 3
would 5
have 11
his 43
coming 3
down 90
He 965
made 13
a 6811
little 6
mistake 5
to 805
be 1205
sure 11
but 82
it 67
is 124
to 805
the 195
credit 12
of 111
his 43
This 6
a 6811
panegyric 3
Jane 9
on 86
his 43
and 51
the 195
little 6
value 8
he 965
put 47
on 86
his 43
own 9
good 28
Elizabeth 5
was 93
to 805
find 10
that 11
he 965
had 11
not 85
the 195
of 111
his 43
friend 15
for 487
though 12
Jane 9
had 11
the 195
most 3
generous 4
and 51
heart 59
in 2721
the 195
world 12
she 199
it 67
was 93
a 6811
circumstance 4
must 28
prejudice 4
her 182
him 9
I 4332
am 394
the 195
most 3
creature 3
that 11
ever 33
Jane 9
Oh 17
why 4
am 394
I 4332
my 90
and 51
blessed 4
above 3
them 9
all 162
If 8
I 4332
but 82
see 70
you 30
as 510
If 8
there 21
were 5
but 82
man 343
for 487
you 30
If 8
you 30
were 5
to 805
give 15
me 1043
men 140
I 4332
never 3
be 1205
so 797
as 510
you 30
Till 14
I 4332
have 11
your 4
disposition 3
your 4

now 10
that 11
she 199
would 5
produce 7
a 6811

her 182
Charlotte 4
as 510
it 67

But 82
no 896

little 6
wilderness 3
on 86
one 19
side 74
of 111
your 4

no 896
effort 7
for 487
conversation 8
with 34
a 6811
woman 21
who 79
was 93
now 10
more 11

the 195
reason 13
of 111
my 90
journey 11
Your 4
own 9
heart 59
your 4
own 9
conscience 4
must 28
tell 16

Madam 5
I 4332

for 487
the 195

of 111
you 30

Miss 72
Bennet 4
her 182

you 30
to 805
know 12
that 11
I 4332
am 394
not 85
to 805

But 82
you 30
may 49
choose 5
to 805
be 1205
you 30
shall 12
not 85

me 1043
so 797
My 90
character 17
has 41
ever 33
for 487

and 51
in 2721
a 6811
cause 14
of 111
moment 15
as 510
this 6
I 4332
shall 12
not 85

A 6811
report 12
of 111
a 6811
most 3
nature 5
me 1043
two 14
ago 15
I 4332
was 93
that 11
not 85
your 4
sister 10
was 93
on 86
the 195
point 22
of 111
being 3
most 3
married 3
but 82
that 11
you 30
that 11
Miss 72
Elizabeth 5
Bennet 4
would 5
in 2721
all 162
likelihood 3
be 1205
soon 3
to 805
my 90
nephew 3
my 90
own 9
nephew 3
Mr 5
Though 12
I 4332
know 12
it 67
must 28
be 1205
a 6811
falsehood 3
though 12
I 4332
would 5
not 85
injure 6
him 9
so 797
as 510
to 805
suppose 4
the 195
truth 7
of 111
it 67
possible 3
I 4332
on 86
setting 3
off 102
for 487
this 6
place 29
that 11
I 4332
might 9
make 17
my 90

you 30
If 8
you 30

true 9
Elizabeth 5
with 34
and 51
disdain 7
I 4332
wonder 17
you 30
the 195
trouble 18
of 111
coming 3
so 797
far 91
What 14
your 4

Your 4
coming 3
to 805
to 805

me 1043
and 51
my 90
Elizabeth 5
will 40
be 1205
a 6811
confirmation 3
of 111
it 67
if 8
a 6811
report 12
is 124
in 2721
existence 3
If 8
Do 815
you 30
then 5
pretend 7
to 805
be 1205
of 111
it 67
Has 41
it 67
not 85

Do 815
you 30
not 85
know 12
that 11
a 6811
report 12
is 124
spread 12
I 4332
never 3
that 11
it 67
was 93
And 51
can 288
you 30
declare 6
that 11
there 21
is 124
no 896
foundation 3
for 487
it 67
I 4332
do 815
not 85
pretend 7
to 805
possess 16
equal 18
with 34
your 4
ladyship 3
You 30
may 49
ask 6
I 4332
shall 12

This 6
is 124
not 85

borne 3
Miss 72

be 1205
so 797
while 4
he 965

use 18
of 111
his 43
reason 13
But 82
your 4
arts 4

may 49
in 2721
a 6811
moment 15
of 111
infatuation 3
have 11
made 13

forget 8
what 14

do 815
you 30
know 12
who 79
I 4332

of 111
a 6811
peculiar 5
kind 31
they 5

Your 4

But 82
the 195

Miss 72
Bennet 4
that 11
I 4332
came 36
here 31
with 34
the 195
resolution 3
of 111
my 90
purpose 12
nor 102
will 40
I 4332
be 1205
it 67
I 4332
have 11
not 85
to 805
submit 5
to 805
any 17
whims 8
I 4332
have 11
not 85
in 2721
the 195
habit 25
of 111
disappointment 3
That 11
will 40
make 17
your 4
situation 3
at 272
present 20
more 11
but 82
it 67
will 40
have 11
no 896
effect 15
on 86
me 1043
I 4332
will 40
not 85
be 1205
Hear 78
me 1043
in 2721
silence 7
My 90
daughter 5
and 51
my 90
nephew 3
are 12
for 487
other 6
They 5
are 12
on 86
the 195
side 74
the 195
same 5
noble 13
line 36
and 51
on 86
the 195
and 51
ancient 8
though 12
fortune 8
on 86
both 8
sides 23
is 124
splendid 4
They 5
are 12
for 487
other 6
by 57
the 195
voice 8
of 111
every 10
member 6
of 111
and 51
what 14
is 124
to 805
divide 10
them 9
The 195
upstart 5
of 111
a 6811
young 10
woman 21
or 333
fortune 8
Is 124
this 6
to 805
be 1205
But 82
it 67
must 28
not 85
shall 12
not 85
be 1205
If 8
you 30
were 5
sensible 3
of 111
your 4
own 9
good 28
you 30
would 5
not 85
wish 13
to 805
quit 15
the 195
sphere 3
in 2721
you 30
have 11
up 194
In 2721
your 4
nephew 3
I 4332
should 7
not 85
consider 13
as 510
that 11
sphere 3
He 965
is 124
a 6811
gentleman 4
I 4332
am 394
a 6811
daughter 5
so 797
far 91
we 446
are 12
equal 18
True 9
You 30
are 12
a 6811
daughter 5
But 82
who 79
was 93
your 4
mother 21
Who 79

Do 815
not 85
imagine 3
me 1043
of 111

Elizabeth 5
if 8
your 4
nephew 3
does 5
not 85
object 26
to 805
them 9
they 5
can 288

Tell 16

purpose 12
of 111
Lady 18

this 6
question 16

Miss 72
Bennet 4
I 4332

and 51
I 4332
to 805
find 10
a 6811
more 11
reasonable 3
young 10
woman 21
But 82
do 815
not 85
deceive 6
into 26
a 6811
belief 3
that 11
I 4332
will 40
ever 33
recede 3
I 4332
shall 12
not 85
go 502
till 14
you 30

given 3
me 1043
the 195
assurance 3
I 4332

And 51
I 4332
never 3
shall 12

it 67
I 4332

anything 3
so 797
unreasonable 3
Your 4

at 272
all 162
more 11
probable 3
him 9
to 805

my 90

his 43

Allow 9

this 6
application 3

frivolous 4
as 510
the 195
application 3
was 93
ill 84
You 30
have 11
my 90
character 17
if 8
you 30
think 8
I 4332
can 288
be 1205

these 4
How 27

your 4

Not 85

To 805

she 199
You 30

every 10
possible 3
method 18

the 195
house 87
And 51

selfish 4
girl 14
Do 815
you 30
not 85
consider 13
that 11
a 6811
connection 3
with 34
you 30
must 28
disgrace 8
him 9
in 2721
the 195
eyes 8
of 111
Lady 18
I 4332
have 11
nothing 5

in 2721
my 90

you 30
or 333
to 805
any 17
person 33
so 797
with 34
me 1043
It 67
is 124
well 24
You 30
refuse 4

oblige 3
me 1043
You 30
refuse 4
to 805
obey 4
the 195
of 111
honour 4
and 51
You 30
are 12
to 805
ruin 10
him 9
in 2721
the 195
opinion 4
of 111
all 162
his 43
friends 5
and 51
make 17
him 9
the 195
contempt 8
of 111
the 195
world 12
nor 102
honour 4
nor 102
Elizabeth 5
have 11
any 17
possible 3
claim 12
on 86
me 1043
in 2721
the 195
present 20
instance 4
No 896
principle 4
of 111
would 5
be 1205
by 57
my 90
marriage 6
with 34
Mr 5
And 51
with 34
regard 7
to 805
the 195
resentment 3
of 111
his 43
or 333
the 195
of 111
the 195
world 12
if 8
the 195
former 3
were 5
by 57
his 43
me 1043
it 67
would 5
not 85
give 15
me 1043
one 19
concern 6
and 51
the 195
world 12
in 2721
general 22
would 5
have 11
too 50
sense 8
to 805
join 16
in 2721
the 195
scorn 10
And 51
this 6
is 124
your 4
real 48
opinion 4
This 6
is 124
your 4
final 18
resolve 5
well 24
I 4332
shall 12
now 10
know 12
how 27
to 805
act 69
Do 815
not 85
imagine 3
Miss 72
Bennet 4
that 11
your 4
ambition 3
will 40
ever 33
be 1205
I 4332
came 36
to 805
try 12
you 30
I 4332
to 805
find 10
you 30
reasonable 3
but 82
depend 17
it 67
I 4332
will 40
carry 12
my 90
point 22
In 2721
this 6
manner 8
Lady 18
on 86
till 14
they 5
were 5
at 272
the 195
door 41
of 111
the 195
carriage 5
when 6
turning 3
round 29
she 199
I 4332
take 18
no 896
leave 14
of 111
you 30
Miss 72
Bennet 4
I 4332
send 10
no 896
to 805
your 4
mother 21
You 30
deserve 4
no 896
attention 3
I 4332
am 394
most 3
Elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
to 805
persuade 6
her 182
ladyship 3
to 805
return 14
into 26
the 195
house 87
into 26
it 67
She 199
the 195
carriage 5
drive 18
as 510
she 199
up 194
Her 182
mother 21
met 181
her 182
at 272
the 195
door 41
of 111
the 195
dressing 3
room 22
to 805
ask 6
why 4
Lady 18
would 5
not 85
come 36
in 2721
and 51
rest 110
She 199
did 23
not 85
choose 5
it 67
her 182
daughter 5
she 199
would 5
go 502
She 199
is 124
a 6811
fine 17
woman 21
and 51
her 182
calling 3
here 31
was 93
civil 15
for 487
she 199
came 36
I 4332
suppose 4
to 805
tell 16
us 70
the 195
were 5
well 24
She 199
is 124
on 86
her 182
road 38
I 4332
dare 15
say 7
and 51
so 797
passing 3
through 4
thought 11
she 199
might 9
as 510
well 24
call 57
on 86
you 30
I 4332
suppose 4
she 199
had 11
nothing 5
particular 13
to 805
say 7
to 805
you 30
Elizabeth 5
was 93
to 805
give 15
into 26
a 6811
little 6
falsehood 3
here 31
for 487
to 805
acknowledge 3
the 195
substance 3
of 111
conversation 8
was 93
Chapter 3
The 195
of 111
this 6
visit 14
Elizabeth 5
into 26
not 85
be 1205
nor 102
she 199
for 487
learn 10
to 805
think 8
of 111
it 67
less 19
than 22
Lady 18
it 67
had 11
the 195
trouble 18
of 111
this 6
journey 11
for 487
the 195
sole 32
purpose 12
of 111
off 102
her 182
engagement 3
with 34
Mr 5
It 67
was 93
a 6811
rational 22
scheme 7
to 805
be 1205
sure 11
but 82
what 14
the 195
report 12
of 111
engagement 3
originate 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
at 272
a 6811
loss 3
to 805
imagine 3
till 14
she 199
that 11
his 43
being 3
the 195
intimate 5
friend 15
of 111
Bingley 4
and 51
her 182
being 3
the 195
sister 10
of 111
Jane 9
was 93
at 272
a 6811
time 45
when 6
the 195
expectation 3
of 111
one 19
wedding 3
made 13
eager 6
for 487
to 805
supply 3
the 195
idea 21
She 199
had 11
not 85
to 805
feel 11
that 11
the 195
marriage 6
of 111
her 182
sister 10
must 28
bring 6
them 9
more 11
together 3
And 51
her 182
at 272
Lucas 4
Lodge 7
for 487
through 4
communication 3
with 34
the 195
the 195
report 12
she 199
had 11
Lady 18
had 11
set 40
that 11
down 90
as 510
certain 5
and 51
immediate 4
she 199
had 11
forward 12
to 805
as 510
possible 3
at 272
some 30
future 3
time 45
In 2721
Lady 18
she 199
not 85
help 23
feeling 4
some 30
as 510
to 805
the 195
possible 3
consequence 3
of 111
her 182
in 2721
this 6
what 14
she 199
had 11
of 111
her 182
resolution 3
to 805
prevent 13
marriage 6
it 67
to 805
Elizabeth 5
that 11
she 199
must 28
meditate 3
an 973
application 3
to 805
her 182
nephew 3
and 51
how 27
he 965
might 9
take 18
a 6811
similar 5
representation 4
of 111
the 195
to 805
a 6811
connection 3
with 34
her 182
she 199
dared 6
not 85
pronounce 7
She 199
not 85
the 195
exact 14
degree 3
of 111
his 43
affection 5
for 487
his 43
aunt 6
or 333
his 43
on 86
her 182
judgment 5
but 82
it 67
was 93
natural 18
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
he 965
thought 11
of 111
her 182
ladyship 3
than 22
she 199
do 815
and 51
it 67
was 93
certain 5
that 11
in 2721
the 195
of 111
a 6811
marriage 6
with 34
one 19
immediate 4
were 5
so 797
unequal 3
to 805
his 43
own 9
his 43
aunt 6
would 5
address 9
him 9
on 86
his 43
side 74
With 34
his 43
of 111
he 965
would 5
feel 11
that 11
the 195
to 805
Elizabeth 5
had 11
weak 20
and 51
ridiculous 4
good 28
sense 8
and 51
solid 21
If 8
he 965
had 11
as 510
to 805
what 14
he 965
should 7
do 815
had 11
often 4
the 195
and 51
of 111
so 797
near 15
a 6811
relation 8
might 9
settle 10
every 10
doubt 15
and 51
determine 7
him 9
at 272
to 805
be 1205
as 510
as 510
make 17
him 9
In 2721
that 11
case 25
he 965
would 5
return 14
no 896
more 11
Lady 18
might 9
see 70
him 9
in 2721
her 182
way 27
through 4
town 27
and 51
his 43

marriage 6
place 29
should 7
be 1205
so 797
I 4332
must 28
not 85
neglect 9
the 195
of 111
my 90
station 13

refrain 5
my 90
at 272
hearing 3
that 11
you 30
the 195

couple 7
into 26
your 4
house 87
as 510

forgive 8
them 9

in 2721
your 4
hearing 3
' 20
That 11
is 124
his 43
notion 5
of 111
Christian 7
The 195
rest 110
of 111
his 43
letter 20
is 124
his 43
dear 15
situation 3
and 51
his 43
expectation 3
of 111

young 10
olive 6

them 9
I 4332
believe 6
I 4332
thought 11
of 111
you 30
Elizabeth 5
was 93
too 50
to 805
say 7
a 6811
word 26
After 48
a 6811
short 62
pause 4
her 182
companion 10
You 30
are 12
too 50
generous 4
to 805
trifle 7
with 34
me 1043
If 8
your 4
are 12
still 13
what 14
they 5
were 5
last 7
April 3
tell 16
me 1043
so 797
at 272
My 90
and 51
are 12
but 82
one 19
word 26
you 30
will 40
silence 7
me 1043
on 86
this 6
subject 11
for 487
ever 33
Elizabeth 5
feeling 4
all 162
the 195
more 11
than 22
common 23
and 51
of 111
his 43
situation 3
now 10
to 805
speak 12
and 51
though 12
not 85
gave 4
him 9
to 805
understand 8
that 11
her 182
had 11
so 797
material 17
a 6811
change 21
since 7
the 195
period 16
to 805
he 965
as 510
to 805
make 17
her 182
receive 8
with 34
and 51
pleasure 5
his 43
present 20
The 195
this 6
reply 3
was 93
as 510
he 965
had 11
never 3
felt 5
and 51
he 965
on 86
the 195
occasion 7
as 510
and 51
as 510
as 510
a 6811
man 343
in 2721
love 30
can 288
be 1205
to 805
do 815
Had 11
Elizabeth 5
able 3
to 805
encounter 5
his 43
eye 57
she 199
might 9
have 11
how 27
well 24
the 195
expression 11
of 111
delight 8
over 598
his 43
face 19
him 9
but 82
though 12
she 199
not 85
look 14
she 199
listen 9
and 51
he 965
her 182
of 111
in 2721
of 111
what 14
she 199
was 93
to 805
him 9
made 13
his 43
affection 5
every 10
moment 15
more 11
valuable 3
They 5
on 86
knowing 3
in 2721
what 14
direction 5
There 21
was 93
too 50
to 805
be 1205
thought 11
and 51
felt 5
and 51
for 487
attention 3
to 805
any 17
other 6
She 199
soon 3
that 11
they 5
were 5
indebted 3
for 487
present 20
good 28
understanding 4
to 805
the 195
of 111
his 43
aunt 6
who 79
did 23
call 57
on 86
him 9
in 2721
her 182
return 14
through 4
London 5
and 51
there 21
relate 8
her 182
journey 11
to 805
motive 4
and 51
the 195
substance 3
of 111
her 182
conversation 8
with 34
Elizabeth 5
dwelling 3
on 86
every 10
expression 11
of 111
the 195
latter 3
in 2721
her 182
apprehension 3
her 182
and 51
assurance 3
in 2721
the 195
belief 3
that 11
a 6811
relation 8
must 28
assist 10
her 182
to 805
obtain 7
that 11
promise 4
her 182
nephew 3
she 199
had 11
to 805
give 15
But 82
for 487
her 182
ladyship 3
effect 15
had 11
It 67
me 1043
to 805
hope 16
he 965
as 510
I 4332
had 11
ever 33
to 805
hope 16
I 4332
of 111
your 4
disposition 3
to 805
be 1205
certain 5
that 11
had 11
you 30
me 1043
you 30
would 5
have 11
it 67
to 805
Lady 18
and 51
Elizabeth 5
and 51
as 510
she 199
Yes 16
you 30
know 12
of 111
my 90
to 805
believe 6
me 1043
of 111
that 11
After 48
you 30
so 797
to 805
your 4
face 19
I 4332
have 11
no 896
scruple 4
in 2721
you 30
to 805
all 162
your 4
relations 5
What 14
did 23
you 30
say 7
of 111
me 1043
that 11
I 4332
did 23
not 85
deserve 4
For 487
though 12
your 4
were 5
ill 84
on 86
my 90
to 805
you 30
at 272
the 195
time 45
had 11
the 195
reproof 5
It 67
was 93
I 4332
think 8
of 111
it 67
We 446
will 40
not 85
quarrel 11
for 487
the 195
share 22
of 111
blame 13
to 805
that 11
evening 3
Elizabeth 5
The 195
conduct 21
of 111
if 8
will 40
be 1205
but 82
since 7
then 5
we 446
have 11
both 8
I 4332
hope 16
in 2721
I 4332
be 1205
so 797
to 805
The 195
recollection 3
of 111
what 14
I 4332
then 5
of 111
my 90
conduct 21
my 90
my 90
the 195
whole 26
of 111
it 67
is 124
now 10
and 51
has 41
painful 6
to 805
me 1043
Your 4
reproof 5
so 797
well 24
I 4332
shall 12
never 3
forget 8
you 30
in 2721
a 6811
more 11
manner 8
' 21
were 5
your 4
words 5
You 30
know 12
not 85
you 30
can 288
conceive 3
how 27
they 5
have 11
me 1043
though 12
it 67
was 93
some 30
time 45
I 4332
confess 14
I 4332
was 93
reasonable 3
to 805
allow 9
justice 3
I 4332
was 93
far 91
them 9
to 805
make 17
so 797
strong 16
an 973
impression 12
I 4332
had 11
not 85
the 195
idea 21
of 111
being 3
ever 33
felt 5
in 2721
a 6811
way 27
I 4332
can 288
believe 6
it 67
You 30
thought 11
me 1043
then 5
of 111
every 10
proper 9
feeling 4
I 4332
am 394
sure 11
you 30
did 23
The 195
turn 46
of 111
your 4
countenance 4
I 4332
shall 12
never 3
forget 8
as 510
you 30
that 11
I 4332
not 85
have 11
you 30
in 2721
any 17
possible 3
way 27
that 11
would 5
induce 9
you 30
to 805
accept 16
me 1043
Oh 17
do 815
not 85
repeat 12
what 14
I 4332
then 5
These 4
will 40
not 85
do 815
at 272
all 162
I 4332
assure 6
you 30
that 11
I 4332
have 11
long 50
most 3
of 111
it 67
his 43
letter 20
Did 23
it 67
he 965
did 23
it 67
soon 3
make 17
you 30
think 8
better 7
of 111
me 1043
Did 23
you 30
on 86
reading 3
it 67
give 15
any 17
credit 12
to 805
She 199
what 14
effect 15
on 86
her 182
had 11
and 51
how 27
all 162
her 182
former 3
had 11
I 4332
he 965
that 11
what 14
I 4332
must 28
give 15
you 30
pain 42
but 82
it 67
was 93
I 4332
hope 16
you 30
have 11
the 195
letter 20
There 21
was 93
one 19
part 102
the 195
opening 3
of 111
it 67
I 4332
should 7
dread 14
your 4
the 195
power 19
of 111
reading 3
I 4332
can 288
remember 4
some 30
might 9
make 17
you 30
hate 14
me 1043
The 195
letter 20
shall 12
be 1205
if 8
you 30
believe 6
it 67
essential 4
to 805
the 195
preservation 5
of 111
my 90
regard 7
but 82
though 12
we 446
have 11
both 8
reason 13
to 805
think 8
my 90
not 85
they 5
are 12
not 85
I 4332
hope 16
so 797
as 510
that 11
When 6
I 4332
that 11
letter 20
I 4332
calm 10
and 51
cool 22
but 82
I 4332
am 394
since 7
that 11
it 67
was 93
in 2721
a 6811
dreadful 4
of 111
spirit 20
The 195
letter 20
in 2721
but 82
it 67
did 23
not 85
end 96
so 797
The 195
adieu 3
is 124
But 82
think 8
no 896
more 11
of 111
the 195
letter 20
The 195
of 111
the 195
person 33
who 79
and 51
the 195
person 33
who 79
it 67
are 12
now 10
so 797
different 11
what 14
they 5
were 5
then 5
that 11
every 10
unpleasant 4
circumstance 4
it 67
to 805
be 1205
You 30
must 28
learn 10
some 30
of 111
my 90
Think 8
of 111
the 195
past 71
as 510
remembrance 3
you 30
pleasure 5
I 4332
give 15
you 30
credit 12
for 487
any 17
of 111
the 195
kind 31
Your 4
must 28
be 1205
so 797
void 6
of 111
reproach 8
that 11
the 195
them 9
is 124
not 85
of 111
but 82
what 14
is 124
better 7
of 111
But 82
with 34
me 1043
it 67
is 124
not 85
so 797
Painful 6
will 40
intrude 6
not 85
to 805
be 1205
I 4332
have 11
a 6811
selfish 4
being 3
all 162
my 90
life 44
in 2721
practice 4
though 12
not 85
in 2721
principle 4
As 510
a 6811
child 28
I 4332
was 93
what 14
was 93
right 31
but 82
I 4332
was 93
not 85
to 805
correct 18
my 90
temper 22
I 4332
was 93
given 3
good 28
but 82
left 19
to 805
follow 11
them 9
in 2721
pride 6
and 51
conceit 7
an 973
son 70
for 487
an 973
child 28
I 4332
was 93
by 57
my 90
who 79
though 12
good 28
my 90
father 12
all 162
that 11
was 93
and 51
me 1043
to 805
be 1205
selfish 4
and 51
to 805
care 47
for 487
none 32
my 90
own 9
circle 7
to 805
think 8
of 111
all 162
the 195
rest 110
of 111
the 195
world 12
to 805
wish 13
at 272
least 3
to 805
think 8
of 111
sense 8
and 51
worth 15
with 34
my 90
own 9
I 4332
was 93
eight 18
to 805
eight 18
and 51
and 51
I 4332
might 9
still 13
have 11
but 82
for 487
you 30
Elizabeth 5
What 14
do 815
I 4332
not 85
owe 5
you 30
You 30
me 1043
a 6811
lesson 3
hard 70
at 272
first 8
but 82
most 3
By 57
you 30
I 4332
was 93
I 4332
came 36
to 805
you 30
a 6811
doubt 15
of 111
my 90
reception 6
You 30
me 1043
how 27
were 5
all 162
my 90
to 805
please 3
a 6811
woman 21
of 111
being 3
Had 11
you 30
then 5
that 11
I 4332
should 7
I 4332
had 11
What 14
will 40
you 30
think 8
of 111
my 90
I 4332
you 30
to 805
be 1205
my 90
My 90
must 28
have 11
in 2721
fault 20
but 82
not 85
I 4332
assure 6
you 30
I 4332
never 3
meant 3
to 805
deceive 6
you 30
but 82
my 90
might 9
often 4
lead 15
me 1043
wrong 24
How 27
you 30
must 28
have 11
me 1043
after 48
that 11
evening 3
Hate 14
you 30
I 4332
was 93
at 272
first 8
but 82
my 90
anger 5
soon 3
to 805
take 18
a 6811
proper 9
direction 5
I 4332
am 394
of 111
what 14
you 30
thought 11
of 111
me 1043
when 6
we 446
met 181
at 272
You 30
me 1043
for 487
coming 3
No 896
I 4332
felt 5
nothing 5
but 82
surprise 4
Your 4
surprise 4
not 85
be 1205
than 22
mine 26
in 2721
being 3
by 57
you 30
My 90
conscience 4
me 1043
that 11
I 4332
no 896
and 51
I 4332
confess 14
that 11
I 4332
did 23
not 85
expect 20
to 805
receive 8
more 11
than 22
my 90
due 21
My 90
object 26
then 5
was 93
to 805
show 64
you 30
by 57
every 10
in 2721
my 90
power 19
that 11
I 4332
was 93
not 85
so 797
mean 36
as 510
to 805
resent 11
the 195
past 71
and 51
I 4332
to 805
obtain 7
your 4
to 805
lessen 4
your 4
ill 84
opinion 4
by 57
you 30
see 70
that 11
your 4
had 11
to 805
How 27
soon 3
any 17
other 6
I 4332
can 288
tell 16
but 82
I 4332
believe 6
in 2721
half 23
an 973
hour 10
after 48
I 4332
had 11
you 30
He 965
then 5
her 182
of 111
delight 8
in 2721
her 182
acquaintance 5
and 51
of 111
her 182
disappointment 3
at 272
sudden 4
interruption 3
to 805
the 195
cause 14
of 111
that 11
interruption 3
she 199
soon 3
that 11
his 43
resolution 3
of 111
following 3
her 182
in 2721
quest 21
of 111
her 182
sister 10
had 11
he 965
the 195
inn 59
and 51
that 11
his 43
and 51
there 21
had 11
no 896
other 6
than 22
what 14
a 6811
purpose 12
must 28
comprehend 4
She 199
her 182
but 82
it 67
was 93
too 50
painful 6
a 6811
subject 11
to 805
to 805
be 1205
on 86
After 48
several 3
miles 4
in 2721
a 6811
manner 8
and 51
too 50
busy 9
to 805
know 12
anything 3
it 67
they 5
found 18
at 272
last 7
on 86
that 11
it 67
was 93
time 45
to 805
be 1205
at 272
home 90
What 14
of 111
Mr 5
Bingley 4
and 51
Jane 9
was 93
a 6811
wonder 17
the 195
discussion 3
of 111
was 93
with 34
engagement 3
his 43
friend 15
had 11
given 3
him 9
the 195
information 3
of 111
it 67
I 4332
must 28
ask 6
you 30
were 5
Elizabeth 5
Not 85
at 272
all 162
When 6
I 4332
I 4332
felt 5
that 11
it 67
would 5
soon 3
happen 9
That 11
is 124
to 805
say 7
you 30
had 11
given 3
your 4
permission 3
I 4332
as 510
And 51
though 12
he 965
at 272
the 195
term 34
she 199
found 18
that 11
it 67
had 11
pretty 4
the 195
case 25
On 86
the 195
evening 3
my 90
going 3
to 805
London 5
he 965
I 4332
made 13
a 6811
confession 6
to 805
him 9
I 4332
believe 6
I 4332
to 805
have 11
made 13
long 50
ago 15
I 4332
him 9
of 111
all 162
that 11
had 11
to 805
make 17
my 90
former 3
in 2721
his 43
absurd 9
and 51
His 43
surprise 4
was 93
great 12
He 965
had 11
never 3
had 11
the 195
suspicion 3
I 4332
him 9
that 11
I 4332
in 2721
as 510
I 4332

And 51

At 272

I 4332

Good 28

so 797
that 11
I 4332
know 12
when 6
it 67
But 82
I 4332
believe 6
I 4332
must 28
date 15
it 67
my 90
first 8
his 43
grounds 10
at 272
that 11
she 199
would 5

effect 15
and 51
she 199

When 6
on 86

Now 10

she 199
for 487
you 30
will 40
be 1205

as 510
I 4332
had 11
a 6811
value 8
for 487
him 9
Were 5
it 67
for 487
nothing 5
but 82
his 43
love 30
of 111
you 30
I 4332
must 28
have 11
him 9
but 82
now 10
as 510
friend 15
and 51
your 4
husband 10
there 21
can 288
be 1205
Bingley 4
and 51
more 11
dear 15
to 805
me 1043
But 82
you 30
have 11
sly 4
reserved 4
with 34
me 1043
How 27
little 6
did 23
you 30
tell 16
me 1043
of 111
what 14
at 272
and 51
I 4332
owe 5
all 162
that 11
I 4332
know 12
of 111
it 67
to 805
not 85
to 805
you 30
Elizabeth 5
her 182
the 195
of 111
her 182
She 199
had 11
unwilling 4
to 805
mention 5
Bingley 4
and 51
the 195
state 41
of 111
her 182
own 9
had 11
made 13
her 182
avoid 8
the 195
name 17
of 111
his 43
friend 15
But 82
now 10
she 199
would 5
no 896
conceal 10
her 182
his 43
share 22
in 2721
marriage 6
All 162
was 93
and 51
half 23
the 195
night 61
in 2721
conversation 8
Good 28
gracious 4
Bennet 4
as 510
she 199
at 272
a 6811
window 12
the 195
morning 3
if 8
that 11
disagreeable 3
Mr 5
is 124
not 85
coming 3
here 31
with 34
our 3
dear 15
Bingley 4
What 14
can 288
he 965
mean 36
by 57
being 3
so 797
tiresome 4
as 510
to 805
be 1205
coming 3
here 31
I 4332
had 11
no 896
notion 5
but 82
he 965
would 5
go 502
a 6811
shooting 3
or 333
something 3
or 333
other 6
and 51
not 85
disturb 11
us 70
with 34
his 43
What 14
shall 12
we 446
do 815
with 34
him 9
you 30
must 28
walk 25
out 365
with 34
him 9
that 11
he 965
may 49
not 85
be 1205
in 2721
way 27
Elizabeth 5
help 23
laughing 6
at 272
so 797
a 6811
proposal 3
yet 4
was 93
that 11
her 182
mother 21
should 7
be 1205
him 9
an 973
epithet 3
As 510
soon 3
as 510
they 5
Bingley 4
at 272
her 182
so 797
and 51
hands 24
with 34
as 510
left 19
no 896
doubt 15
of 111
his 43
good 28
information 3
and 51
he 965
soon 3
Bennet 4
have 11
you 30
no 896
more 11
in 2721
may 49
lose 5
her 182
way 27
to 805
day 27
I 4332
advise 9
Mr 5
and 51
and 51
Bennet 4
to 805
walk 25
to 805
Mount 34
this 6
morning 3
It 67
is 124
a 6811
nice 11
long 50
walk 25
and 51
Mr 5
has 41
never 3
the 195
view 18
It 67
may 49
do 815
well 24
for 487
the 195
Mr 5
Bingley 4
but 82
I 4332
am 394
sure 11
it 67
will 40
be 1205
too 50
for 487
it 67
that 11
she 199
had 11
stay 7
at 272
home 90
a 6811
great 12
to 805
see 70
the 195
view 18
the 195
Mount 34
and 51
Elizabeth 5
As 510
she 199
up 194
to 805
get 13
Bennet 4
her 182
saying 3
I 4332
am 394
that 11
you 30
should 7
be 1205
to 805
have 11
that 11
disagreeable 3
man 343
all 162
to 805
But 82
I 4332
hope 16
you 30
will 40
not 85
mind 25
it 67
it 67
is 124
all 162
for 487
sake 3
you 30
know 12
and 51
there 21
is 124
no 896
occasion 7
for 487
to 805
him 9
except 10
just 24
now 10
and 51
then 5
So 797
do 815
not 85
put 47
to 805
inconvenience 4
walk 25
it 67
was 93
that 11
Mr 5
consent 5
should 7
be 1205
in 2721
the 195
course 10
of 111
the 195
evening 3
Elizabeth 5
reserved 4
to 805
the 195
application 3
for 487
her 182
She 199
not 85
determine 7
how 27
her 182
mother 21
would 5
take 18
it 67
all 162
his 43
wealth 7
and 51
would 5
be 1205
to 805
her 182
of 111
the 195
man 343
But 82
she 199
were 5
set 40
the 195
match 25
or 333
with 34
it 67
it 67
was 93
certain 5
that 11
her 182
manner 8
would 5
be 1205
ill 84
to 805
do 815
credit 12
to 805
her 182
sense 8
and 51
she 199
no 896
more 11
bear 30
that 11
Mr 5
should 7
hear 78
the 195
first 8
of 111
her 182
joy 36
than 22
the 195

In 2721

soon 3
after 48

also 3
and 51
follow 11

and 51
her 182
agitation 3
on 86
it 67
was 93
extreme 8
She 199
did 23
not 85
fear 14
her 182
opposition 3
but 82
he 965
was 93
going 3
to 805
be 1205
made 13
and 51
that 11
it 67
should 7
be 1205
through 4
her 182
that 11
she 199
his 43
favourite 3
child 28
should 7
be 1205

by 57
her 182
choice 5
should 7
be 1205
filling 3
him 9
with 34
and 51
in 2721
of 111
her 182
was 93
a 6811
wretched 6
reflection 3
and 51
she 199
sat 92
in 2721
till 14
Mr 5
when 6
at 272
him 9
she 199
was 93

his 43
smile 7
In 2721
a 6811

minutes 3

she 199
was 93
sitting 3
with 34

Her 182
father 12
was 93

grave 28
and 51
anxious 4
he 965
what 14
are 12
you 30
doing 3
Are 12

out 365
of 111
your 4

be 1205
this 6
man 343
Have 11
not 85
you 30

How 27
did 23
she 199
then 5
wish 13
that 11
her 182
former 3
had 11
more 11
reasonable 3
her 182
more 11
moderate 7
It 67
would 5
have 11
her 182
and 51
it 67
was 93
awkward 6
to 805
give 15
but 82
they 5
were 5
now 10
and 51
she 199
assured 4
him 9
with 34
some 30
confusion 3
of 111

Mr 5
Or 333
in 2721
other 6
words 5
you 30
are 12
to 805
have 11
him 9
He 965
is 124
rich 19
to 805
be 1205
sure 11
and 51
you 30
may 49
have 11
more 11
fine 17
clothes 10
and 51
fine 17
than 22
Jane 9
But 82
will 40
they 5
make 17
you 30
Have 11
you 30
any 17
other 6
objection 5
Elizabeth 5
than 22
your 4
belief 3
of 111
my 90
None 32
at 272
all 162
We 446
all 162
know 12
him 9
to 805
be 1205
a 6811
proud 5
unpleasant 4
sort 14
of 111
man 343
but 82
this 6
would 5
be 1205
nothing 5
if 8
you 30
him 9
I 4332
do 815
I 4332
do 815
like 22
him 9
she 199
with 34
in 2721
her 182
eyes 8
I 4332
love 30
him 9
he 965
has 41
no 896
pride 6
He 965
is 124
You 30
do 815
not 85
know 12
what 14
he 965
is 124
then 5
pray 9
do 815
not 85
pain 42
me 1043
by 57
of 111
him 9
in 2721
her 182
father 12
I 4332
have 11
given 3
him 9
my 90
consent 5
He 965
is 124
the 195
kind 31
of 111
man 343
to 805
whom 3
I 4332
should 7
never 3
dare 15
refuse 4
anything 3
he 965
to 805
ask 6
I 4332
now 10
give 15
it 67
to 805
you 30
if 8
you 30
are 12
on 86
him 9
But 82
let 50
me 1043
advise 9
you 30
to 805
think 8
better 7
of 111
it 67
I 4332
know 12
your 4
disposition 3
I 4332
know 12
that 11
you 30
be 1205
nor 102
you 30
your 4
husband 10
you 30
up 194
to 805
him 9
as 510
a 6811
superior 5
Your 4
would 5
place 29
you 30
in 2721
the 195
danger 7
in 2721
an 973
unequal 3
marriage 6
You 30
escape 10
discredit 7
and 51
My 90
child 28
let 50
me 1043
not 85
have 11
the 195
grief 3
of 111
you 30
to 805
respect 18
your 4
partner 8
in 2721
life 44
You 30
know 12
not 85
what 14
you 30
are 12
Elizabeth 5
still 13
more 11
was 93
earnest 8
and 51
solemn 21
in 2721
her 182
reply 3
and 51
at 272
length 14
by 57
that 11
Mr 5
was 93
the 195
object 26
of 111
her 182
choice 5
by 57
the 195
gradual 6
change 21
her 182
estimation 3
of 111
him 9
had 11
her 182
absolute 7
that 11
his 43
affection 5
was 93
not 85
the 195
work 87
of 111
a 6811
day 27
but 82
had 11
the 195
test 50
of 111
suspense 3
and 51
with 34
all 162
his 43
good 28
she 199
did 23
conquer 8
her 182
and 51
reconcile 3
him 9
to 805
the 195
match 25
Well 24
my 90
dear 15
he 965
when 6
she 199
I 4332
have 11
no 896
more 11
to 805
say 7
If 8
this 6
be 1205
the 195
case 25
he 965
you 30
I 4332
not 85
have 11
with 34
you 30
my 90
to 805
less 19
To 805
complete 8
the 195
impression 12
she 199
then 5
him 9
what 14
Mr 5
had 11
done 3
for 487
Lydia 5
He 965
her 182
with 34
This 6
is 124
an 973
evening 3
of 111
And 51
so 797
did 23
every 10
thing 15
made 13
up 194
the 195
match 25
gave 4
the 195
money 17
the 195
and 51
got 14
him 9
his 43
commission 10
So 797
the 195
better 7
It 67
will 40
save 7
me 1043
a 6811
world 12
of 111
trouble 18
and 51
Had 11
it 67
your 4
doing 3
I 4332
must 28
and 51
would 5
have 11
him 9
but 82
these 4
young 10
carry 12
every 10
thing 15
own 9
way 27
I 4332
shall 12
offer 10
to 805
pay 52
him 9
to 805
morrow 3
he 965
will 40
rant 9
and 51
storm 11
his 43
love 30
for 487
you 30
and 51
there 21
will 40
be 1205
an 973
end 96
of 111
the 195
matter 7
He 965
then 5
her 182
embarrassment 3
a 6811
few 6
on 86
his 43
reading 3
Mr 5
letter 20
and 51
after 48
laughing 6
at 272
her 182
some 30
time 45
her 182
at 272
last 7
to 805
go 502
saying 3
as 510

If 8
any 17

I 4332
am 394
at 272
leisure 8
mind 25
was 93
now 10
a 6811
heavy 7
weight 21
and 51
after 48
half 23
an 973
quiet 20
reflection 3
in 2721
her 182
own 9
room 22
she 199
was 93
able 3
to 805
join 16
the 195
with 34
Every 10
thing 15
was 93
too 50
recent 6
for 487
but 82
the 195
evening 3
there 21
was 93
no 896
anything 3
material 17
to 805
be 1205
and 51
the 195
comfort 14
of 111
ease 10
and 51
would 5
come 36
in 2721
time 45
When 6
her 182
mother 21
up 194
to 805
her 182
dressing 3
room 22
at 272
night 61
she 199
her 182
and 51
made 13
the 195
communication 3
effect 15
was 93
most 3
for 487
on 86
first 8
hearing 3
it 67
Bennet 4
sat 92
still 13
and 51
to 805
utter 10
a 6811
syllable 3
Nor 102
was 93
it 67
under 288
minutes 3
that 11
she 199
comprehend 4
what 14
she 199
though 12
not 85
in 2721
general 22
backward 5
to 805
credit 12
what 14
was 93
for 487
the 195
advantage 6
of 111
her 182
or 333
that 11
came 36
in 2721
the 195
shape 13
of 111
a 6811
lover 3
to 805
any 17
of 111
them 9
She 199
at 272
length 14
to 805
recover 8
to 805

in 2721
her 182

down 90
wonder 17
and 51
bless 9
Good 28
gracious 4
Lord 13
bless 9
me 1043
think 8
dear 15
me 1043
Mr 5
Who 79
would 5
have 11
thought 11
it 67
And 51
is 124
it 67
true 9
Oh 17
my 90
how 27
rich 19
and 51
how 27
great 12
you 30
will 40
be 1205
What 14
pin 131
money 17
what 14
what 14
you 30
will 40
have 11
is 124
nothing 5
to 805
it 67
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
I 4332
am 394
so 797
so 797
a 6811
man 343
so 797
handsome 6
so 797
tall 35
Oh 17
my 90
dear 15
pray 9
for 487
my 90
him 9
so 797
I 4332
hope 16
he 965
will 40
overlook 5
it 67
Dear 15
dear 15
A 6811
house 87
in 2721
town 27
Every 10
thing 15
that 11
is 124
Three 12
married 3
Ten 151
thousand 7
a 6811
year 20
Oh 17
Lord 13
What 14
will 40
of 111
me 1043
I 4332
shall 12
go 502
This 6
was 93
to 805
prove 21
that 11
her 182
approbation 3
need 29
not 85
be 1205
and 51
Elizabeth 5
rejoicing 3
that 11
an 973
effusion 3
was 93
by 57
soon 3
But 82
she 199
had 11
three 12
minutes 3
in 2721
her 182
own 9
room 22
her 182
mother 21
her 182
My 90
child 28
she 199
I 4332
can 288
think 8
of 111
nothing 5
Ten 151
thousand 7
a 6811
year 20
and 51
more 11
as 510
good 28
as 510
a 6811
Lord 13
And 51
a 6811
special 19
You 30
must 28
and 51
shall 12
be 1205
married 3
by 57
a 6811
special 19
But 82
my 90
love 30
tell 16
me 1043
what 14
dish 53
Mr 5
is 124
fond 17
of 111
that 11
I 4332
may 49
have 11
it 67
to 805
morrow 3
This 6
was 93
a 6811
sad 47
omen 3
of 111
what 14
her 182
to 805
the 195
gentleman 4
might 9
be 1205
and 51
Elizabeth 5
found 18
that 11
though 12
in 2721
the 195
certain 5
possession 3
of 111
his 43
affection 5
and 51
secure 6
of 111
her 182
consent 5
there 21
was 93
still 13
something 3
to 805
be 1205
for 487
But 82
the 195
morrow 3
off 102
better 7
than 22
she 199
for 487
Bennet 4
in 2721
awe 10
of 111
her 182
intended 3
son 70
in 2721
law 45
that 11
she 199
not 85
to 805
speak 12
to 805
him 9
it 67
was 93
in 2721
her 182
power 19
to 805
offer 10
him 9
any 17
attention 3
or 333
mark 47
her 182
for 487
his 43
opinion 4
Elizabeth 5
had 11
the 195
satisfaction 3
of 111
her 182
father 12
taking 4
pains 4
to 805
get 13
with 34
him 9
and 51
Mr 5
Bennet 4
soon 3
assured 4
her 182
that 11
he 965
was 93
rising 3
every 10
hour 10
in 2721
his 43
esteem 5
I 4332
admire 6
all 162
my 90
three 12
in 2721
law 45
he 965
is 124
my 90
favourite 3
but 82
I 4332
think 8
I 4332
shall 12
like 22
your 4
husband 10
as 510
well 24
as 510
Chapter 3
soon 3
rising 3
to 805
she 199
Mr 5
to 805
account 14
for 487
his 43
ever 33
in 2721
love 30
with 34
her 182
How 27
you 30
begin 8
she 199
I 4332
can 288
comprehend 4
your 4
going 3
on 86
when 6
you 30
had 11
made 13
a 6811
beginning 3
but 82
what 14
set 40
you 30
off 102
in 2721
the 195
first 8
place 29
I 4332
fix 27
on 86
the 195
hour 10
or 333
the 195
spot 24
or 333
the 195
look 14
or 333
the 195
words 5
the 195
foundation 3
It 67
is 124
too 50
long 50
ago 15
I 4332
was 93
in 2721
the 195
middle 14
I 4332
that 11
I 4332
had 11
My 90
you 30
had 11
and 51
as 510
for 487
my 90
my 90
to 805
you 30
was 93
at 272
least 3
on 86
the 195
uncivil 3
and 51
I 4332
never 3
spoke 14
to 805
you 30
to 805
give 15
you 30
pain 42
than 22
not 85
Now 10
be 1205
sincere 4
did 23
you 30
admire 6
me 1043
for 487
my 90
impertinence 3
For 487
the 195
of 111
your 4
mind 25
I 4332
did 23
You 30
may 49
as 510
well 24
call 57
it 67
impertinence 3
at 272
It 67
was 93
little 6
less 19
The 195
fact 35
is 124
that 11
you 30
were 5
sick 38
of 111
of 111
of 111
officious 4
attention 3
You 30
were 5
with 34
the 195
women 6
who 79
were 5
and 51
and 51
for 487
your 4
approbation 3
I 4332
and 51
you 30
I 4332
was 93
so 797
unlike 10
them 9
Had 11
you 30
not 85
you 30
would 5
have 11
me 1043
for 487
it 67
but 82
in 2721
spite 10
of 111
the 195
pains 4
you 30
to 805
disguise 4
your 4
were 5
noble 13
and 51
just 24
and 51
in 2721
your 4
heart 59
you 30
the 195
who 79
so 797
you 30
There 21
I 4332
have 11
you 30
the 195
trouble 18
of 111
for 487
it 67
and 51
all 162
I 4332
begin 8
to 805
think 8
it 67
reasonable 3
To 805
be 1205
sure 11
you 30
no 896
actual 11
good 28
of 111
me 1043
but 82
of 111
that 11
when 6
they 5
fall 29
in 2721
love 30
Was 93
there 21
no 896
good 28
in 2721
your 4
to 805
Jane 9
while 4
she 199
was 93
ill 84
at 272
Jane 9
who 79
have 11
done 3
less 19
for 487
her 182
But 82
make 17
a 6811
virtue 3
of 111
it 67
by 57
all 162
My 90
good 28
are 12
under 288
your 4
protection 8
and 51
you 30
are 12
to 805
exaggerate 4
them 9
as 510
as 510
possible 3
and 51
in 2721
return 14
it 67
to 805
me 1043
to 805
find 10
for 487
and 51
with 34
you 30
as 510
often 4
as 510
may 49
be 1205
and 51
I 4332
shall 12
begin 8
by 57
you 30
what 14
made 13
you 30
so 797
unwilling 4
to 805
come 36
to 805
the 195
point 22
at 272
last 7
What 14
made 13
you 30
so 797
shy 14
of 111
me 1043
when 6
you 30
first 8
and 51
here 31
Why 4
when 6
you 30
did 23
you 30
look 14
as 510
if 8
you 30
did 23
not 85
care 47
me 1043
you 30
were 5
grave 28
and 51
silent 6
and 51
gave 4
me 1043
no 896
encouragement 3
But 82
I 4332
was 93
And 51
so 797
was 93
I 4332
You 30
might 9
have 11
to 805
me 1043
more 11
when 6
you 30
came 36
to 805
dinner 9
A 6811
man 343
who 79
had 11
felt 5
less 19
might 9
How 27
that 11
you 30
should 7
have 11
a 6811
reasonable 3
answer 8
to 805
give 15
and 51
that 11
I 4332
should 7
be 1205
so 797
reasonable 3
as 510
to 805
admit 7
it 67
But 82
I 4332
wonder 17
how 27
long 50
you 30
would 5
have 11
gone 4
on 86
if 8
you 30
had 11
left 19
to 805
I 4332
wonder 17
when 6
you 30
would 5
have 11
if 8
I 4332
had 11
not 85
you 30
My 90
resolution 3
of 111
you 30
for 487
your 4
kindness 3
to 805
Lydia 5
had 11
great 12
effect 15
Too 50
I 4332
am 394
for 487
what 14
of 111
the 195
moral 25
if 8
our 3
comfort 14
springs 3
a 6811
breach 5
of 111
promise 4
for 487
I 4332
not 85

hope 16
you 30
will 40
think 8
